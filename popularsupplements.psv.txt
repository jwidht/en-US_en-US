ZMA|ZMA is a patented formulation, which contains zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6.~~~~It is claimed to increase testosterone levels, but there is no evidence to suggest that this occurs in healthy men. Though men with zinc deficiencies can supplement zinc to fix their deficiency and increase their testosterone levels, there is no evidence to suggest this occurs in men with no deficiency.~~~~Aspartate has also been claimed to increase testosterone, but it is in too low of a dose in ZMA to have any effect on testosterone.~~~~Despite ZMA’s lack of effect on testosterone levels, it can be a useful supplement for people that lack zinc and magnesium.
Yohimbine|Yohimbe, and its subset yohimbine, are fat-burning compounds, primarily used to lose fat during short term fasting.~~~~Yohimbine is also an aphrodisiac and can aid erectile dysfunction. It is also a general stimulant.~~~~Yohimbine works by increasing adrenaline levels in the body, as well as inhibiting a regulatory process in fat cells, which normally suppresses fat burning.~~~~The effects of yohimbine are partially negated by food intake, which is why it is often taken in a fasted state.~~~~Yohimbe is highly stimulatory~~~~There is a high chance of yohimbine interacting with neurological medication~~~~Many supplements containing yohimbine either do not list its dose, or its dose is inaccurate by up to 150%
Whey Protein|Whey protein is a collection of proteins found in whey, a byproduct of cheesemaking. When a coagulant (usually renin) is added to milk, the curds (casein) and whey separate; whey protein is the water-soluble part of milk. As a supplement, it’s sold as dry powders with various levels of processing that affect how concentrated a source of protein they are and how fast they’re absorbed.~~~~~~What are the benefits of whey protein?~~It’s a high quality, well-absorbed source of protein that’s very useful for hitting targeted daily protein goals. Its benefits extend to the benefits of increased protein intake in general, such as augmenting muscle gain in conjunction with resistance training, limiting muscle loss during low-calorie diets, and modestly limiting fat gain during periods of excessive calorie intake. These effects aren’t exclusive to whey protein but it will likely be more effective than most other protein sources per gram.~~~~~~What are whey protein’s side effects and drawbacks?~~Whey does not harm the liver or kidneys, but it can exacerbate pre-existing damage. People with damaged livers or kidneys should exercise caution when increasing protein intake quickly without the guidance of a doctor.
Vitamin D|Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient. It is one of the 24 micronutrients critical for human survival. The sun is the major natural source of the nutrient, but vitamin D is also found naturally in fish and eggs. It is also added to dairy products.~~~~Supplemental vitamin D is associated with a wide range of benefits, including increased cognition, immune health, bone health and well-being. Supplementation can also reduce the risks of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. People deficient in vitamin D may also experience increased testosterone levels after supplementation.~~~~The body produces vitamin D from cholesterol, provided there is an adequate amount of UV light from sun exposure. There is only a sufficient amount of UV light coming from the sun when the UV index is 3 or higher, which only occurs year-round near the equator, between the 37th parallels.~~~~Most people are not deficient in vitamin D, but they do not have an optimal level of vitamin D either. Due to the many health benefits of vitamin D, supplementation is encouraged if optimal levels are not present in the body.
Testosterone Boosting|You may know your total testosterone levels, but they don’t tell the whole story. Your total testosterone can be divided into three categories:~~~~Tightly-bound testosterone. About two-thirds of the testosterone in your blood is bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Your body can’t use it.~~~~Loosely-bound testosterone. About a third of the testosterone in your blood is bound to albumin. Your body can use it, with some effort.~~~~Free testosterone. A small percentage of the testosterone in your blood (1–4%, as a rule) just floats around freely. Your body can readily use it, and the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase can convert it to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) — a very potent androgen.~~~~Together, your loosely-bound and your free testosterone compose your bioavailable testosterone, which has a greater impact on your health than your total testosterone.~~~~Testosterone boosters are supplements that increase your production of testosterone. Often included in this category are also supplements that only increase your percentage of free testosterone or your DHT.~~~~~~Aromatase inhibitors~~Supplements that inhibit CYP19A1, the aromatase enzyme, are indirect testosterone boosters in men. CYP19A1 serves many purposes, one of which is to convert testosterone to estradiol, the predominant form of estrogen. Inhibiting this enzyme reduces the percentage of testosterone that gets converted to estradiol.~~~~Contrary to what you might think, the male body needs estradiol,[1] though in lesser quantity than women do. When it detects that its estradiol levels are too low, it reacts by increasing its production of the base material it needs to make estradiol — in other words, it increases its production of testosterone.~~~~Aromatase inhibitors can boost testosterone on their own, but they can also complement other testosterone boosters. If you take a supplement that increases testosterone without inhibiting the aromatase enzyme (through hypothalamic stimulation, for instance), you may find yourself with more estradiol than you need, a situation that taking an aromatase inhibitor may remedy.~~~~If you’re a man, that is. As we saw, aromatase inhibitors hinder the conversion of androgens to estrogens; in premenopausal women, however, ovaries produce most of the estrogen, so aromatase inhibitors are much less effective.
Spirulina|Spirulina is a blue-green algae. It is an easily produced, non-toxic species of Arthrospira bacteria.~~~~Spirulina is often used as a vegan source of protein and vitamin B12. It is between 55-70% protein, but studies suggest it is a subpar source of B12, as the vitamin is not absorbed well after ingestion.~~~~Human evidence suggests that spirulina can improve lipid and glucose metabolism, while also reducing liver fat and protecting the heart. Animal studies are very promising as well, as spirulina has been shown to be of similar potency as commonly used reference drugs, when it comes to neurological disorders. These effects also extend to arthritis and immunology.~~~~Spirulina has a few active components. The main ingredient is called phycocyanobilin, which makes up about 1% of spirulina. This compound mimics the body’s bilirubin compound, in order to inhibit an enzyme complex called Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. By inhibiting NADPH oxidase, spirulina provides potent anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.~~~~The neurological effects of spirulina need more human evidence. Based on animal evidence, spirulina appears to be a promising anti-oxidant and supplement for metabolic issues.
L-Carnitine|L-Carnitine is a compound produced by the body from lysine and methionine. It can be acetylated to produce Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR), which is similar but crosses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently. L-Carnitine is best known for its involvement in the mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids.~~~~It's found in food and is most prevalent in meat, and beef in particular.~~~~There are various forms of carnitine supplementation available. Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) is used for cognitive enhancement. L-Carnitine L-Tartrate (LCLT) is typically used for physical performance and power output. Glycine Propionyl L-Carnitine (GPLC) is used to alleviate intermittent claudication and blood flow issues.~~~~What are L-Carnitine's benefits?~~A notable improvement in sperm quality has been found with supplementation of high doses. It may modestly reduce fatigue in elderly people with low muscular endurance but its effects on athletes during physical activity aren't well-supported. L-Carnitine may slightly limit muscle damage during resistance exercise. Minor beneficial effects on blood glucose and insulin sensitivity have been noted in people with diabetes and healthy people alike, but much more reseearch is needed to confirm this.~~~~When it comes to fat-burning, studies on ALCAR in isolation do not show very good results. Some studies have found minor fat loss, which is typically attributed to increased physical activity due to increased energy levels.~~~~~~What are L-Carnitine's side effects and downsides?~~A few studies have noted a benign adverse effect of 'odd smell', which is said to be due to the formation of trimethylamines; it has occurred at a frequency of 4%.~~~~~~Does L-carnitine help with weight loss?~~Probably only if it helps to reduce fatigue and that leads to an increase in physical activity. It's possible that very low carnitine levels could lead to impaired fatty acid oxidation, but for most people, there isn't a notable increase in resting fatty acid oxidation when taking L-carnitine.
Green Tea Catechins|Green tea (Camellia Sinensis) is a plant frequently steeped in hot water and drunk as tea. It exerts most of its benefits through water-soluble polyphenols (frequently referred to as catechins) extracted from the leaves, into water, which is then consumed.~~~~It has been implicated in benefiting almost every organ system in the body. It is cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-obesity, anti-carcinogenic, anti-diabetic, anti-artherogenic, liver protective and beneficial for blood vessel health. These beneficial effects are seen in doses present both in green tea itself (as a drink) as well as from a supplemental form.~~~~Green tea can be stimulatory~~~~If steeped too long, green tea can possess a very bitter taste due to its tannin content. Tannins may not be bad inherently, but the taste is sometimes seen as a turn-off.~~~~'Green tea extract' in pills, unless processing is specified, can be as simple as a capsule of tea leaves. There is little to no difference between tea in liquid form and capsules, aside from possibly dosage and taste.~~~~Although milk proteins can form complexes with green tea catechins (which makes them temporarily indigestible), these complexes are digested and the green tea is released in the intestines, so it may be absorbed.

Fish Oil|Fish oil is a common term used to refer to two kinds of omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These omega-3 fats are usually found in fish, animal products, and phytoplankton.~~~~The fatty acids EPA and DHA are involved in regulating various biological processes such as the inflammatory response, various metabolic signaling pathways, and brain function. They can be synthesized in the body from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), but in small amounts for most people.~~~~~~What are fish oil's benefits?~~Fish oil causes a potent reduction in triglyceride levels and a more modest reduction in blood pressure in hypertensives. Despite this, long-term trials haven't found a reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events.~~~~It appears to notably improve mood in people with major depression, though it's unclear if it has an effect in people with minor depression. EPA, in particular, seems to be the most effective omega-3 fatty acid for this purpose which suggests that the effects of fish oil are due to reducing neuroinflammation. Its anti-inflammatory benefits also seem to extend to reducing the symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus. However, its benefits shouldn't be assumed to extend to inflammatory diseases in general.~~~~~~What are fish oil's side effects and drawbacks?~~Many fish oil supplements may contain harmful lipid peroxides (oxidized lipids that can damage cells), but it's unclear if this has notable consequences to health.~~~~~~What is the difference between fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids?~~"Fish oil" refers to a solution of fatty acids where the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are dominant. Fish is by far the most common source for fish oil, hence the name, but an artificially manufactured EPA/DHA dominant mixture from any source could be considered fish oil. Typical fish oil can contain small amounts of other omega-3 fatty acids, usually DPA and fatty acids that don't belong to the omega-3 category. Alpha-linolenic acid (found most abundantly in nuts and seeds), is an omega-3 fatty acid that can be turned into EPA and DHA but is not itself a fish oil fatty acid.~~~~Though fish oil is not a stimulant, it increases brain activity, so a stimulatory effect may be felt after supplementation~~~~Most of fish oil's beneficial effects happen over a period of days and weeks, rather than immediately~~~~Post-supplementation "fish burps" can be avoided by consuming fish oil with food, or freezing the capsules before supplementation
D-Aspartic Acid|D-aspartic acid is one of two forms of the amino acid aspartic acid. The other form is L-aspartate.~~~~The benefits of D-AA are specific to it, and do not extend to aspartic acid or L-aspartate.~~~~D-AA can be used as a testosterone booster for infertile men, and by athletes as a temporary booster. Elevated testosterone levels only last a week to a week and a half in healthy men, with testosterone returning to normal afterward.~~~~D-AA works in the central brain region to cause a release of hormones, such as luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and growth hormone. It may also build up in the testicles, where it alleviates a rate-limiting step of testosterone synthesis, which leads to a minor testosterone increase.~~~~Further research is needed on D-AA, as most studies attempt to assess D-AA’s role in the body under normal conditions, and not in the frame of supplementation.
Creatine|Creatine is a molecule that's produced in the body from amino acids. It's primarily made in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidneys and pancreas. It stores high-energy phosphate groups in the form of phosphocreatine which are donated to ADP, regenerating it to ATP, the primary energy carrier in the body. This role in energy production is particularly relevant under conditions of high energy demand such as intense physical or mental activity.~~~~Creatine can be found in some foods and is most prevalent in meat and fish. Athletes commonly take it as a powder or in capsules.~~~~~~What are creatine’s benefits?~~The primary benefit of creatine is an improvement in strength and power output during resistance exercise. For this purpose, creatine is well-researched, and the effects are quite notable for a supplement. When used in conjunction with resistance exercise, creatine may modestly increase lean mass. It has also been tested for anaerobic running capacity in many studies, the results of which are fairly mixed but generally suggest a small improvement in performance.~~~~While creatine has been research far less for cognitive performance than physical performance, it may have benefits in some contexts. A reduction in mental fatigue has been observed in various scenarios such as demanding mental activity, sleep deprivation, and traumatic brain injury. Creatine may improve working memory, though likely only for those with below average creatine levels such as vegetarians and the elderly. We need more research in these areas and other cognitive measures before creatine can be said to be effective.~~~~~~What are creatine’s side effects and drawbacks?~~When taken without sufficient water, stomach cramping can occur. Diarrhea and nausea can occur when too much creatine is taken at once, in which case doses should be spread out throughout the day and taken with meals.~~~~~~Is creatine safe?~~Most of the supposed dangers of creatine are unfounded. Due to the bad reputation of performance-enhancing drugs, it has been wrongfully equated with the worst examples. It also increases levels of creatinine in the body, which are a marker of poor kidney function. However, the increase in creatinine isn't due to kidney damage, but simply more creatinine being produced. There is a lack of long-term studies in people with reduced kidney function, however, so caution could still be taken in that instance. Besides the minor gastrointestinal issues from excessive creatine, it is unlikely to be unsafe or bad for you.~~~~There have been some anecdotal reports of a subtle but noticeable stimulatory effect on alertness, but this may be a placebo effect.~~~~There have been some anecdotal reports of restlessness when creatine is supplemented less than an hour before falling asleep.~~~~The water retention usually seen with higher loading doses can exceed five pounds (more than two kilograms). Lower doses may cause less water retention. While water mass is not muscle mass (though both count as lean mass), prolonged creatine supplementation results in an increased rate of muscle growth.~~~~Hyperhydration strategies (creatine plus glycerol) appear inefficacious as drug-masking strategies.~~~~There are many different forms of creatine available on the market, but creatine monohydrate is the cheapest and most effective. Another option is micronized creatine monohydrate, which dissolves in water more easily and can be more practical.
Branched Chain Amino Acids|Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) refers to three amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine.~~~~For people with low dietary protein intake, BCAA supplementation can promote muscle protein synthesis and increase muscle growth over time. Supplementation can also be used to prevent fatigue in novice athletes.~~~~Leucine plays an important role in muscle protein synthesis, while isoleucine induces glucose uptake into cells. Further research is needed to determine valine’s role in a BCAA supplement.~~~~Supplementing BCAAs prevents a serum decline in BCAAs, which occurs during exercise. A serum decline would normally cause a tryptophan influx into the brain, followed by serotonin production, which causes fatigue.~~~~BCAAs are important to ingest on a daily basis, but many protein sources, such as meat and eggs, already provide BCAAs. Supplementation is unnecessary for people with a sufficiently high protein intake (1-1.5g per kg of bodyweight a day or more).~~~~The standard dosage for isoleucine is 48-72mg per kilogram of bodyweight, assuming a non-obese person. The standard leucine dosage is between 2-10g. A combination dose is 20g of combined BCAAs, with a balanced ratio of leucine and isoleucine.~~~~Isoleucine is used for increasing glucose uptake into cells, while leucine is used to improve muscle protein synthesis.~~~~BCAA supplementation is not necessary if enough BCAAs are provided through the diet. Further research is needed to determine valine’s optimal dosage and reason for supplementation.
Beta-Alanine|Beta-alanine is a modified version of the amino acid alanine.~~~~Beta-alanine has been shown to enhance muscular endurance. Many people report being able to perform one or two additional reps in the gym when training in sets of 8–15 repetitions. Beta-alanine supplementation can also improve moderate- to high-intensity cardiovascular exercise performance, like rowing or sprinting.~~~~When beta-alanine is ingested, it turns into the molecule carnosine, which acts as an acid buffer in the body. Carnosine is stored in cells and released in response to drops in pH. Increased stores of carnosine can protect against diet-induced drops in pH (which might occur from ketone production in ketosis, for example), as well as offer protection from exercise-induced lactic acid production.~~~~Large doses of beta-alanine may cause a tingling feeling called paresthesia. It is a harmless side effect.~~~~Standard daily dose: 2–5 g.~~~~While beta-alanine is a popular ingredient in pre-workout stacks, supplementation is actually not timing-dependent.~~~~Large doses of beta-alanine may result in a tingling feeling called paresthesia. This harmless side effect can be avoided by using a time-release formulation or by taking smaller doses (0.8–1 g) several times a day.
