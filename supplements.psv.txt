Lysine|Lysine is an amino acid commonly paired with Vitamin C in many supplements. While an essential amino acid it does not hold much promise as a supplement beyond reducing the symptoms of herpes simplex.
Lutein|Lutein, as well as the related zeaxanthin, are carotenoid structures similar to pre-vitamin A (β-carotene) and involved in eye health. A dietary component of eggs, lutein appears to be effective for this claim and a general antioxidant.~~~~Lutein is a carotenoid structure similar to Zeaxanthin, and the two are components of many food products such as egg yolks and paprika. Lutein may bioaccumulate in the eyes where it is thought to reduce oxidative stress.
Limonene|D-Limonene is a molecule that is found in high levels in lemons (where it derives its name) but also most citrus foods. It holds promise as an anti-cancer agent, and for some reason is marketed as a fat burner despite minimal evidence of fat burning effects. Can be consumed via pulpy lemon juice.~~~~D-Limonene is a compound known as 'lemon extract' and is found in high levels in lemon juices.~~~~It itself, as well as its related product known as 'perillic acid', are known to be anti-carcinogenic (cancer fighting) and liver healthy. Consumption of D-Limonene in either supplemental form or as freshly squeezed and pulp-containing lemonade has been shown to reduce the formation of some tumor growths and alleviate fat buildup in the liver induced by diet.~~~~Although commercial juices tend to have low levels of D-Limonene, freshly squeezed 'Mediterranean Style' juice with the pulp has high levels of it.~~~~Caution Notice~~Limonene is non-stimulatory~~~~Limonene is one of the volatiles in citrus fruit responsible for its aroma~~~~Limonene levels are high in citrus peels, and pulp containing juices have higher amounts of limonene than do pulp-free variants
Light Therapy|Light therapy is basically exposure to sunlight or bright lights during the day, and most well known for simply increasing Vitamin D synthesis rates independent of supplementation. It possesses many similarities to Vitamin D, but perhaps some more.~~~~Light therapy is basically exposure to sunlight or bright lights during the day. It has been investigated for treatment of a variety of conditions including skin disorders such as eczema and acne vulgaris; mood and sleep disorders such as seasonal affective disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, and delayed sleep phase syndrome; and has even been used to promote wound healing.
Licorice|Licorice is the common name for plants of the Glycyrrhiza family. It may contain protective flavanoids. Glycyrrhetic acid (a component of licorice) may decrease testosterone and increase cortisol.~~~~Licorice (Glycyrrhiza plants, usually the Glabra species) have been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to fairly good acclaim for various digestive and health problems, and as a general vitality promoting agent. Licorice is also routinely used as a candy product, and is inherently a functional food rather than just a candy (as the oil containing the traditional licorice flavor also contains some bioactive compounds).~~~~One of the most important compounds in Licorice appears to be Glycyrrhizin, which is the sugar-bound form of Glycyrrhetic Acid (there exists both an alpha and beta isomer, with the latter 18β-Hydroxyglycyrrhetic acid being referred to frequently). This compound is highly relevant when consuming pure licorice extracts due to its good absorption and relatively high content, but also underlies a fairly reliable reduction in testosterone and a highly reliable increase in circulating cortisol after consumption. Both of these effects are dose-dependent and not associated with any toxicological effects (and reversed upon cessation of Licorice), but many persons may want to avoid Glycyrrhizin and Glycyrrhetic Acid due to these reasons.~~~~An ethanolic extract of Licorice, sometimes used in supplements, is able to concentrate flavanoids and isoflavanoid compounds with a relatively low Glycyrrhizin content. Some of these flavanoids, including Glabridol as well as the Liquirtigenin class of flavanoids, appear to be the ones that exert properties that would be seen as 'beneficial'.~~~~Caution Notice~~Glabridin (component of Licorice) appears to potently inhibit CYP3A4, an enzyme used in the metabolism of many drugs. There is potential for adverse drug-nutrient interactions
Leucine|Leucine is the primary BCAA, and is the BCAA where most benefit is given to. Supplementing Leucine on its own is still beneficial and may be cheaper than BCAA mixes; they all still taste bitter, however.~~~~Leucine is one of the three branched chain amino acids and sometimes referred to as the 'main' amino acid due to the most popular benefit of BCAAs (muscle building) being mostly due to leucine. Leucine is an activator of the protein known as mTOR, which then induces muscle protein synthesis via S6K; the other two BCAAs may also activate mTOR, but are much weaker than leucine in doing so (and as such, 5g of leucine will be more effective than 5g mixed BCAAs). The leucine metabolite, HMB, is also weaker than leucine at inducing muscle protein synthesis despite being more effective at preserving lean mass from breakdown.~~~~Leucine is a tad different from the other two BCAAs isoleucine and valine as leucine seems to have a fair bit of testing on the amino acid in isolation rather than in a BCAA mixture, whereas the other two BCAAs are not as well studied.~~~~The studies assessing leucine mostly look at muscle protein synthesis when additional leucine is added to the diet or to a test meal, and it appears that leucine is able to reliably increase muscle protein synthesis after test meals. Whether this results in more lean mass over a period of time is somewhat less reliable though, and leucine appears to be more effective at promoting gains in muscle in people with lower dietary protein intake and in the elderly (who tend to have impaired muscle protein synthesis in response to the diet).~~~~The interactions of leucine on glucose are not clear, to be honest. Leucine possesses both blood sugar reducing properties (can release insulin from the pancreas, can directly stimulate glucose uptake into a cell without insulin) but also the opposite (via stimulating S6K, it can inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake). In a cell culture, leucine stimulates glucose uptake for up to 45 minutes and then hinders itself while in living systems acute doses of leucine do not appear to do anything remarkable (some limited evidence that leucine can be rehabilitative in diabetes, but this is preliminary). Isoleucine is a more potent hypoglycemic agent, but to less inhibition of its own actions.
Leucic Acid|Leucic acid (also known as α-hydroxyisocaproic acid or HICA) is a leucine metabolite touted to have anabolic properties. Although it appears to be effective following oral supplementation, comparisons to leucine or HMB do not exist.~~~~Leucic acid (synonymous with the term α-hydroxyisocaproic acid and the latter's acronym HICA) is a metabolite of the branched chain amino acid known as leucine; leucine initially goes into one of two metabolic pathways (KIC or HMB) and then some of the KIC is further converted into HICA.~~~~HICA is claimed to be an anti-catabolic and anabolic agent similar to HMB. The limited evidence that exists right now (literally one study in athletes and a mention of a pilot study conducted by the same researchers) suggests that there is benefit, but beyond needing replication this study is also confounded.~~~~Although it would be imprudent to say that HICA is ineffective (which it does not appear to be) and similarly imprudent to say that it is worse than HMB or leucine, due to the lack of comparative data between HICA and HMB/leucine the question of 'which one to use' cannot be answered and we have no indication if HICA is better or worse than the other options.~~~~HICA holds some promise for future research to tackle, but currently does not have enough evidence to support its usage as a supplement; it may simply be a more expensive and equally effective leucine.
Lavender|Lavender is a family of plants known for its anxiety-reducing properties. Lavandula, or lavender, is a genus of plants used for essential oil and aromatherapy. Lavender supplementation can temporarily alleviate anxiety.~~~~Though lavender does not have a sedative effect, lavender aromatherapy can improve sleep quality, as well as reduce insomnia. Some evidence suggests lavender can increase slow-wave sleep patterns.~~~~Most studies use the lavender oil brand Silexan. There is some evidence to suggest lavender may offer benefits for people suffering from dementia, but it is very preliminary and much more research is needed.~~~~Topical application of lavender can result in contact dermatitis, which is characterized by red and itchy skin.
Lactobacillus reuteri|Lactobacillus reuteri is a species of probiotic bacteria. It may provide some benefits for cholesterol levels, reducing H. pylori levels (the pathogenic bacterium which contributes to ulcers), female urinary tract and vaginal health, and infant gastrointestinal health.~~~~Lactobacillus reuteri is a species of bacteria that belongs to one of the major lactic-acid producing genera of bacteria. It can be found in the human intestinal tract, though not always and often in relatively low numbers. Lactobacillus reuteri is also found in the gut of other mammals and birds.~~~~Initially, Lactobacillus reuteri was used to treat necrotizing colitis, a gastrointestinal disease characterized by infection and inflammation that is particularly dangerous for infants, particularly those born prematurely. Lactobacillus reuteri was used due to its anti-inflammatory effects. The research on Lactobacillus reuteri and necrotizing colitis used the Lactobacillus reuteri strains ATCC 55730 and its daughter strain DSM 17938, both of which can survive oral supplementation.~~~~Interest in Lactobacillus reuteri grew after research confirmed that changing aspects of the digestive system can influence the immune system. A strain of Lactobacillus reuteri called ATCC PTA 6475 has been found to improve levels of testosterone and oxytocin, as well as skin quality in animal studies. Research on animals has also found potential benefits for hair quality, bone mass and preventing weight gain from obesity-causing diets.~~~~One of the ways Lactobacillus reuteri may work involves a kind of T cell called a Treg cell (a T cell that down-REGulates the immune system in part by producing a cytokine called IL-10). Lactobacillus reuteri increases the amount of Treg cells in the body, which suppresses the actions of another kind of T cell called a Th17 cell (which secretes IL-17). Preserving or reversing this process (either by increasing IL-10 or by blocking IL-17) appears to provide therapeutic benefits.~~~~Lactobacillus reuteri increases the number of Treg cells in the intestines, which can then be absorbed back into the blood to benefit the rest of the body.
Lactobacillus casei|Lactobacillus casei (usually as Shirota, known as Yakult) is a bacterial strain seen as probiotic.
L-Tyrosine|L-Tyrosine is an amino acid that is used to produce noradrenaline and dopamine; it appears to reduce stress during exposure to acute stressors (which tend to deplete noradrenaline) and may help to prevent stress-induced memory deficits.~~~~What is L-Tyrosine?~~L-Tyrosine is an amino acid found in the diet that is metabolized to produce catecholamines such as dopamine and adrenaline. It is also used in the production of thyroid hormones. For these reasons, weight loss supplements often include it.~~~~~~What are L-Tyrosine's benefits?~~When it comes to the topic of actually increasing dopamine and adrenaline outright, L-tyrosine does not seem to hold much promise. The synthesis of catecholamines is highly regulated in the body, so simply increasing the amount of L-tyrosine in your body does not necessarily increase catecholamine production.~~~~However, some studies have noted that in stressful situations where noradrenaline exerts a protective effect, supplying L-tyrosine seems to provide a 'safety buffer' of building blocks that can prolong the anti-stress effect of catecholamines by delaying their depletion. This has been noted in situations of cold stress and sleep deprivation in humans but at a relatively high dose of 150mg/kg. Improvements in memory during stressful situations have also been found. However, more research is needed to confirm this. What little research we have doesn't suggest an effect on depression.~~~~~~What are L-Tyrosine'side effects and drawbacks?~~It's generally safe, however, studies using high doses have noted increased heart rate, blood pressure, and worsened symptoms of schizophrenia in patients.~~~~Caution Notice~~L-tyrosine is stimulatory. It may thus theoretically interact with other stimulatory pharmaceuticals or supplements.~~~~L-tyrosine can theoretically interact with the absorption of some drugs that look like certain amino acids (e.g. levodopa). It can also theoretically interact with MAOIs and exacerbate hyperthyroid conditions.
L-Threonate|A metabolite of vitamin C that may have unique effects in the body, it is currently being researched for use as a mineral chelating agent able to greatly enhance bioavailability of minerals (such as Magnesium-L-Threonate).~~~~L-Threonate is a metabolite of vitamin C that is currently being investigated for some vitamin C-like properties as well as its ability to greatly enhance mineral uptake.
L-DOPA|L-DOPA is a direct precursor to dopamine, and its supplementation can increase dopamine levels in the body. It is known as Levodopa and is one component of most Parkinson's treatments, and found in high amounts in Mucuna Pruriens.
L-Carnitine|L-Carnitine and ALCAR are two related compounds used for a variety of purposes, including boosting exercise performance and improving cognition and depression. L-Carnitine is often used for fat loss, but evidence doesn't support this indication.~~~~What is L-Carnitine?~~L-Carnitine is a compound produced by the body from lysine and methionine. It can be acetylated to produce Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR), which is similar but crosses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently. L-Carnitine is best known for its involvement in the mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids.~~~~It's found in food and is most prevalent in meat, and beef in particular.~~~~~~What are L-Carnitine's benefits?~~A notable improvement in sperm quality has been found with supplementation of high doses. It may modestly reduce fatigue in elderly people with low muscular endurance but its effects on athletes during physical activity aren't well-supported. L-Carnitine may slightly limit muscle damage during resistance exercise. Minor beneficial effects on blood glucose and insulin sensitivity have been noted in people with diabetes and healthy people alike, but much more research is needed to confirm this.~~~~When it comes to fat-burning, studies on ALCAR in isolation do not show very good results. Some studies have found minor fat loss, which is typically attributed to increased physical activity due to increased energy levels.~~~~~~What are L-Carnitine's side effects and downsides?~~A few studies have noted a benign adverse effect of 'odd smell', which is said to be due to the formation of trimethylamines; it has occurred at a frequency of 4%.~~~~~~Does L-carnitine help with weight loss?~~Probably only if it helps to reduce fatigue and that leads to an increase in physical activity. It's possible that very low carnitine levels could lead to impaired fatty acid oxidation, but for most people, there isn't a notable increase in resting fatty acid oxidation when taking L-carnitine.
Krill Oil|Krill oil is a mixture of fatty acids high in EPA and DHA (fish oil fatty acids) in the form of phospholipids, mostly as phosphatidylcholine; it appears to be better absorbed than fish oil, may be more cardioprotective, and has some unique (unexplored) fat burning effects.~~~~Krill Oil is an oil that is derived from krill; it contains the same two fatty acids that Fish Oil contains (Eicosapentaenoic Acid, or EPA, and Docosahexaenoic Acid, DHA). However, a large portion of the EPA and DHA in krill is in the form of a phospholipid, with a phosphate group on the end of the fatty acid. This results in higher bioavailability (rate of absorption) of krill oil, and thus the same effects of Fish Oil can be seen with Krill Oil but at a lower dose.~~~~Supplementation of Krill oil tends to be in the range of 1-3g daily (overall oil weight), which has been used in the clinical trials of krill oil supplementation.~~~~If supplementing in accordance with the omega-3 content, the omega-3 content that is supplemented from krill oil should be equal to approximately 2/3rds that used with basic fish oil supplementation to account for the increased absorption. If one were to normally supplement 1000mg EPA plus DHA, then 660mg of EPA and DHA from krill oil would be equivalent.
Kombucha|Kombucha is a fermented form of Camellia sinensis, the plant that makes green and black tea. Though it is thought to be a healthy drink, improper preparation can cause toxicity and has resulted in multiple deaths.~~~~Kombucha, sometimes called mushroom tea (though it does not contain Bioactive Mushrooms) is a fermented tea from the plant Camellia sinensis. Kombucha is a green or black tea that is fermented for a week after sugars, fungi, and bacteria have been added to it.~~~~The fermentation process produces a variety of acidic compounds that are claimed to benefit health through detoxification and anti-oxidation. Kombucha is also thought to promote longevity.~~~~Though kombucha is a popular product, its actual effects on health are lacking. Kombucha contains more anti-oxidants than other teas, but there is not enough evidence to compare it against other standards like Green Tea Catechins and vitamin c.~~~~Hypothetically, kombucha can aid detoxification through its main bioactive, which is called saccharolactone, but this has not been tested in people.~~~~Improper sanitation and too long of a fermentation period can contribute to kombucha’s toxicity, which can result in death. Usually, this is because an individual was brewing their own kombucha, but death has also resulted from drinking too much kombucha (more than 14oz). Most of the evidence supporting kombucha's potential benefits is limited to rodents, while much of the evidence demonstrating its risks extends to humans. Therefore, it is not recommended to drink kombucha for its health benefits.
King Oyster|King Oyster (Pleurotus eryngii) is a dietary mushroom that contains an assortment of bioactive molecules. Oyster mushrooms in general tend to be more popular than other Bioactive Mushrooms due to their taste and usage in meals.~~~~King Oyster mushrooms are a species of the Pleurotus family of mushrooms, and related to regular Oyster mushrooms. They have a large stem that confers a relatively 'meaty' or 'hearty' flavor (Umami) and are seen as a medicinal mushroom.~~~~Not too many studies are conducted on King Oyster mushrooms, but they appear to have the same properties of regular bioactive mushrooms in the sense that they interact with the immune system and may 'boost' immunity to sickness. King Oysters seem to be more potent at suppressing fatty acid absorption relative to other mushrooms according to one study, and have been implicated in increasing testosterone 5-fold. This latter study was conducted with very high doses (15-20% of feed) and was conducted in elk (out of all research animals, elk) and has not been replicated.~~~~It also appears to be more estrogenic and bone protective in animal forms of menopause than other medicinal mushrooms tested.
Ketogenic diet|Why was keto the most-Googled diet of 2018? Two reasons. First, it forces you to give up the most common junk foods, like cookies and chips. This can easily lead to weight loss and feeling better, although much of the initial weight loss is glycogen and water, rather than fat. Second, keto has emerging evidence for use in conditions such as diabetes, and is already established as an epilepsy treatment. Evidence is mixed for athletics and muscle gain, although more research is coming out each month. Stay tuned to this page, as 141 trials are ongoing!~~~~What is keto, and why might it help your health?~~~~On the one hand, keto is a fairly simple concept:~~~~When most people eat less than around 50 grams a day of carbohydrate, they soon start producing high levels of something called "ketone bodies". These are simply breakdown products of fat, and are used to fuel cells that normally depend on glucose.~~~~On the other hand, keto's impact on health isn't so simple:~~~~Your brain and nervous system usually run on glucose. Fueling it mostly with ketones is a whole new world to these cells, and may provide benefit. The main condition this has been studied for is epilepsy, but research on other conditions is underway.~~~~Keto's impact OUTSIDE of that, though, is more complicated. Keto is purported to aid with weight loss more so than other weight loss diets. The evidence for this is mixed, but tends to show fairly similar weight loss among diets when food quality is controlled for. Keto benefits for a variety of conditions may stem from restriction of carbohydrate, avoidance of typical carb-containing junk foods (so not the carb itself, but the food that contains it), and/or benefits from the ketone bodies themselves.~~~~Is keto safe? Are there any detriments?~~~~There are three different purported reasons that keto might not be totally safe:~~~~First is the claim that high levels of ketones can be dangerous. This is generally not true with ketogenic diets, as ketoacidosis (dangerously high ketone levels) doesn't occur absent an uncontrolled medical condition. Ketones are acidic though (...).~~~~Second is the idea that going too long without getting "enough" carbohydrate can be dangerous. This is also generally not true, as carbohydrate isn't an essential nutrient (you can make all you need to live, by a process called gluconeogenesis, without ingesting any through food or drink). We don't know, though, whether ketogenic diets have any negative impact on things like longevity (...).~~~~Finally, claims of harm from diets high in animal products, which is true of most keto diets. This claim is nearly impossible to evaluate with a simple yay or nay, given the huge number of studies involved with varying conclusions. What we know is that (...).
Kava|Kava is a herb that has traditionally been drunk as a hypnotic and anxiety reducer. It has been shown effective in reducing anxiety, sometimes at a potency similar to pharmaceuticals; may be a cognitive enhancer, but not completely safe.~~~~When supplementing Kava, initially an extract known as WS1490 should be sought out. 300mg of this extract daily (in three divided doses of 100mg) appears to be reliable and effective for the treatment of anxiety and other cognitive issues. Doses of up to 800mg of the WS1490 extract have been tolerated for short periods of time.~~~~Otherwise, supplementation of any product conferring 250mg collective kavalactones (the active ingredients) is used.~~~~Although it is usually taken at multiple times throughout the day with meals, if a single dose per day is being used it tends to be used prior to sleep.
Kaempferol|Kaempferol is one of the bioflavonoids that is present in high levels in cruciferous vegetables, and may mediate some of the bioactivities of these plants. It appears to hold anti-cancer potential.~~~~Kaempferol is one of the many flavonoids found in foods alongside others like luteolin and quercetin. It is showing promise in and of itself in being an anti-obesity agent and anti-cancer agent.~~~~Research on kaempferol is scarce in humans in supplemental form, but in vitro research seems promising.
Kaempferia parviflora|Kaempferia Parviflora (Thai Ginseng) is a root plant that is touted to be an aphrodisiac and glucose support agent, with its effects on testosterone and aphrodisia relatively unresearched; it may be (slightly) erectogenic by various mechanisms.~~~~Kaempferia Parviflora (Thai Ginseng) is a herb that has some historical and medicinal usage for treating metabolic ailments and improving vitality in Thailand and limited to surrounding regions. It is also reported to be an aphrodisiac compound and physical enhancer.~~~~Currently, the research on Thai Ginseng is at a moderate level and starting to get human trials. It appears to be 'healthy' and a good source of a class of bioflavonoid compounds with methoxy groups added to them, known as methoxyflavones.~~~~That being said, the research on its aphrodisiac effects in mice indicate that low doses are weak to moderate in potency and higher doses fail to exert any aphrodisiac effect. It does not appear to increase testosterone in otherwise normal rats (although it may in castrated rats), and although it appears to have a variety of mechanisms to be pro-erectile, these have not been tested for potency in a living system. The mechanism of pro-erectility is fairly unique and interesting, but the one study to investigate whether or not it could inhibit PDE5 (one of the mechanisms of Viagra) failed to establish whether it was selective. Selective PDE5 inhibitors are good pro-erectiles without many side-effects, but the non-selectivity (currently not established) may lead to gastrointestinal side effects.~~~~At least one study has noted that it can increase functionality and cardiovascular performance in otherwise healthy persons over 60, but an acute study in youth failed to find any performance enhancing effects at 1.35g (recommended dose, or at least near it).~~~~Currently, Thai Ginseng seems to be weakly promising on proerectility with the other claims not really being better than other possible supplement choices.~~~~According to traditional usage of Kaempferia Parviflora,[1] 0.5-1 teaspoon of ground power is made into a tea and drank about 1-2 hours before physical performance. This is similar to the recommended daily dose from the Thai traditional medicine institute of 1.2g daily, and the one human study on the matter (failing to note benefit acutely) used 1.35g.~~~~General health protective effects have been noted at lower doses, although not enough evidence exists to suggest an optimal dose.
Juniperus chinensis|Juniperus Chinensis is a plant with folklore but no proven medical uses; is an effective insect repellant. It may have protective effects against colon cancer, and the lone rat study assessing glucose tolerance noted fairly remarkable anti-diabetic effects.~~~~Juniperus Chinensis is a plant that is a functional house decoration as it has some insect repellant properties. It has some folklore usage for some things, which has spurred limited amounts of research into the herb. Nothing substantial has been conducted though.~~~~Currently, we have lackluster fat burning potential and one study in rats on blood glucose. This study on blood glucose is actually quite remarkable in effect size, but it needs to be replicated in another animal models since the active drug it was compared to might not have been properly evaluated chosen. The effects on colon cancer cells appear to be promising, but no studies have compared the potency of the active component (Widdrol) against an active drug control or used any living models to test; currently preliminary.~~~~It does have a historical use of being an abortifacient (inducing abortions) so it is probably prudent to not consume Juniperus containing products if pregnant; no studies have been conducted on this, however.
Japanese Knotweed|Japanese Knotweed, or Polygonum Cuspidatum, is a Traditional Chinese Medicine used for circulation and heart health. It is a very good source of resveratrol, and most benefits of Japanese Knotweed may actually just be benefits of Resveratrol.~~~~Polygonum Cuspidatum var. Japonicus is the species of plant most commonly referred to as Japanese Knotweed. This plant is an invasive species yet has been used traditionally in Chinese and Japanese medicine for its benefits on gastrointestinal health and circulatory health (among some other claims such as cancer prevention). Composition analysis of Japanese Knotweed reveals it to be a vessel for Resveratrol (as well as a few other compounds structurally similar to resveratrol and may act in the same way) and anthraquinone compounds that possess slight laxative effects; like Senna root but less potent.~~~~Most of the effects of Japanese Knotweed can be traced back to either the stilbenes (resveratrol) or the anthraquinones (emodin) for the circulatory and gastrointestinal help, respectively.~~~~Most research on Japanese Knotweed has been pertaining to either suppressing its invasive tendencies, or controlling it to become a large scale producer of Resveratrol for medical or supplemental usage. Limited trials have been conducted in humans, but it appears to have similar effects to resveratrol due to the resveratrol content.
Isoleucine|Isoleucine is one of the three branched chain amino acids and appears to promote glucose consumption and uptake. Isoleucine may have roles as an anti-catabolic agent (without promoting synthesis) similar to HMB.~~~~Isoleucine is one of the three branched chain amino acids alongside both leucine and valine. Relative to the other two BCAAs, isoleucine is intermediate for its ability to induce muscle protein synthesis (stronger than valine, but much weaker than leucine) but is able to significantly increase glucose uptake and the usage of glucose during exercise. Isoleucine does not promote glycogen synthesis, however.~~~~Via a PI3K/aPKC dependent mechanism (which is notable since this is neither mediated by the more common AMPK mechanism seen with supplements like berberine nor muscle contraction-mediated uptake) isoleucine can increase glucose uptake into a muscle cell. Leucine also appears to have this ability, but due to leucine stimulating a protein known as S6K (required for protein synthesis) leucine reduces its own efficacy by hindering insulin-stimulated uptake. In other words, while isoleucine and leucine both stimulate glucose uptake leucine then shoots itself in the foot and hinders itself while isoleucine just acts in a predictable and linear manner.~~~~Although extensive human testing has not been conducted yet, isoleucine can be seen as the BCAA which mediates glucose uptake (into a cell) and breakdown (into energy) to a larger degree than other amino acids and may serve a role as a hypoglycemic (in diabetics) or as a performance enhancer (if taken preworkout in a carbohydrate replete state).~~~~Isoleucine, practically speaking, is likely only a good supplement to purchase when wanting to increase glucose uptake; it is outperformed by leucine for inducing muscle protein synthesis and outperformed by HMB for reducing muscle protein breakdown, yet outperforms both of those agents and valine in increasing glucose uptake into skeletal muscle.~~~~As efficacy has been noted with 0.3-0.45g/kg in rats (the latter being the maximal dose, increasing beyond that does nothing more due to no further absorption) a recommended dosage range for isoleucine per se is 48-72mg/kg (for a 150lb person, 3.3-4.9g).~~~~Isoleucine can be found in branched chain amino acids (in which case, the ratio listed on the label should be investigated and the BCAAs dosed accordingly) and in food products. As isoleucine from food products is also bioactive, supplemental doses of isoleucine taken with meals can be lower (ie. if eating a meal with 50g protein that contains 4g isoleucine already, then a 10.8g dose is no longer needed and 6.8g will suffice).
Irvingia gabonensis|Irvingia Gabonensis (African Mango) is a supplement derived from the seeds of the plant known as African Mango (not related to common Mango fruits); there is insufficient evidence to support its usage as a fat burning supplement, and it may merely be a vessel for fiber and fatty acids.~~~~Irvingia gabonensis is a seed with a high fat content, with little to no historical medicinal usage but is either used in production for cosmetics or other products (due to the physical properties of fatty acids in general) and is sometimes used as a soup thickening agent. The fatty acids in question are mostly saturated and either medium or long in chain length.~~~~This seed is touted to be a fat burning agent based on subpar evidence, as all studies conducted right now have a degree of methodological flaw associated with them and some are confounded with financial support from producers of irvingia gabonensis supplementation. There are no known unique bioactives known yet from irvingia gabonensis that are not located in other food products.~~~~The seed may have health properties in some instances, like most food products do; that being said, there is not enough evidence to support the usage of this seed for any particular use yet.
Iron|Iron is an essential mineral best known for allowing blood to carry oxygen between tissues. Except in case of deficiency, iron supplementation has no proven benefit; on the contrary, it can lead to iron poisoning.~~~~Iron is an essential dietary mineral present in a wide variety of foods, but the iron found in plants (notably grains and legumes) is less bioavailable than the iron found in meat (in the form of heme).~~~~In our bodies, iron can bind with porphyrin to make heme; it can then carry oxygen. Proteins with a heme group are called hemoproteins, of which the best known are erythrocytes (the red blood cells). Therefore, having enough iron in your diet is necessary for your red blood cells to deliver oxygen to your tissues. In addition, iron is a cofactor for many enzymes.~~~~Iron deficiency leads to anemia, whose first symptoms are pallor and fatigue. Iron deficiency is the only reason to consider iron supplementation, though getting more iron through foods should be preferred when possible. For people who already have enough iron, taking an iron supplement has no proven benefit; on the contrary, it can lead to iron overdose.
Iodine|Iodine is a mineral for thyroid function found mostly in iodized table salt, fish, and highest in seaweed. Depsite most first world diets being sufficient in iodine, it may benefit those who do not consume seafood and are also in a high risk population (pregnancy and intentional salt restriction).~~~~Iodine is an essential mineral in the diet due to its importance towards cognition and fetal development secondary to being required for thyroid hormones; iodine is central to the active thyroid hormones T3 and T4, and a true iodine deficiency results in less of these hormones and may result in reduced cognition (if a subclinical deficiency) or cretinism (severe deficiency in utero).~~~~Despite the importance of iodine, it is not a common dietary supplement. This is due to table salt being iodized (added iodine) and even relative deficiencies being quite rare in first world countries (it is a common issue in developing countries due to iodine only naturally occurring from fish and seaweed which may not be consumed); actually benefitting from supplementation of iodine requires a 'perfect storm' of situations to occur which are outlined in the dosing section but not many people will meet these requirements.~~~~Supplementation of high doses of iodine in otherwise healthy people does not appear to result in much, since it is readily excreted and normalized. There may be a very small and (clinically) irrelevant antiinflammatory effect and a small reduction in thyroid hormones (rather than an increase), but that seems to be it. Obscenely high doses for a prolonged period of time, which occurs with consumption of unprocessed seaweed (mostly kombu) will result in benign goiter in all persons and thyrotoxicity in some persons with underlying thyroid issues.~~~~Supplementation of iodine is designed to circumvent a deficiency, and deficiencies of iodine are quite rare in first world countries. For those in a first world country, iodine should only be considered if you meet all of the following requirements:~~~~You are a vegetarian or vegan who actively avoids processed foods, or a meat eater who never eats fish and avoids processed foods~~~~You avoid adding additional salt to your diet~~~~You avoid consumption of seaweed or seaweed based products (such as sushi, which are wrapped with Nori)~~~~Assuming all the criteria are met, recommendations for iodine intake tend to be in the range of 75-150 μg (micrograms) or 0.075-0.15 mg daily while higher doses are not inherently dangerous although there may be a slight suppression of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) at 500 μg or above.
Inositol|Inositol usually refers to Myo-inositol, a small molecule structurally similar to glucose that is involved in cellular signalling. It appears to be an effective anxiolytic at higher doses, and is quite effective in treating insulin resistance and PCOS with standard doses.~~~~Inositol is a word that collectively refers to molecules with a similar structure, a collection of nine stereoisomers. While the term 'inositol' is used commonly with dietary supplements, it usually refers to a specific stereoisomer called myo-inositol. Inositols are pseudovitamin compounds that are falsely said to belong to the B-complex family, and are found in most foods but in highest levels in whole grains and citrus fruits.~~~~Myo-inositol shows the most promise as a dietary supplement for promoting female fertility, restoring insulin sensitivity in instances of resistance (type II diabetes and polycystic ovarian syndrome being the most well investigated), and for reducing anxiety as well. Due to the mixed benefits to insulin resistance and fertility, myo-inositol is considered a good treatment for PCOS in women.~~~~It also holds some promise as an anti-depressant (although not as impressive as its anxiolytic and anti-panic effects) and against some other conditions associated with anxiety such as panic disorders and binge eating. It is relatively ineffective for schizophrenia and autism, and has failed in treating PTSD despite its anti-panic effects.~~~~In part because of its benefits to fertility and PCOS, as well as the anxiolytic effects potentially helping symptoms of PMS (dysphoria and anxiety mostly), myo-inositol is sometimes referred to as a general female health supplement. At times, the anti-depressant effects associated with this supplement seem to only work in females with males having no benefit.~~~~It is a very safe supplement to ingest, and all side-effects associated with myo-inositol are merely mild gastrointestinal distress from high doses. High doses (usually in the 12-18g range) are required for any neurological effects while lower doses (2-4g) are sufficient for fertility and insulin sensitizing effects.
Idebenone|Idebenone (CV-2619) is a synthetic derivative of CoQ10 that appears to retain the antioxidative and bioenergetic effects of its parent compound. It appears to be useful in certain disease states.
Hypericum perforatum|Hypericum Perforatum (St. John's Wort) is an anti-depressant herb that is commonly used for its neurological effects. While it appears effective, it is well known to adversely interact with a variety of pharmaceuticals.~~~~St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a herb which, through the active component hypericin, works as a dopamine-related anti-depressant and is effective at doing so. This is also the prototypical 'adverse drug-interaction' herb; it interacts with several compounds by affecting the several phase I enzymes as well as other drug elimination pathways.~~~~Caution Notice~~~~St. John's Wort induces (increases the amount of) CYP3A4, and should not be used by pharmaceuticals that are metabolized by this enzyme
Huperzine-A|Huperzine-A is a cognitive enhancer that inhibits an enzyme that degrades the learning neurotransmitter, acetylcholine; due to this, a relative increase occurs. It belongs to the cholinergics class of molecules, and may be useful in fighting cognitive decline in the elderly. May need to be cycled.~~~~Huperzine-A is a compound extracted from the herbs of the Huperziceae family. It is known as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which means that it stops an enzyme from breaking down acetylcholine which results in increases in acetylcholine.~~~~Acetylcholine is known as the learning neurotransmitter, and is involved in muscle contraction as well. Increasing levels of acetylcholine is routinely used as a technique amongst weight-lifters and scholars.~~~~Huperzine-A appears to be a relatively safe compound from animal studies of toxicity and studies in humans showing no side-effects at dosages routinely supplemented with. Huperzine-A is in preliminary trials for usage in fighting Alzheimer's Disease as well.~~~~Caution Notice~~~~Huperzine-A appears to be water-soluble, and taking with food is not needed~~~~Although its initial spike is quick, it appears to have a long half-life; the pharmacokinetic profile might change when changing dosages though.~~~~How to Take Huperzine-A~~Recommended dosage, active amounts, other details~~Supplementation of huperzine-A tends to be in the range of 50-200mcg daily, and while this can be divided into multiple dosages throughout the day it tends to be taken at a single dose. Supplementation of huperzine-A does not require food to be coingested with it and can be taken in a fasted state.~~~~Cycling of huperzine-A tends to be used since it can remain in the body for quite some time (half-life of 10-14 hours), and although a 'cycle' of huperzine-A tends to last 2-4 weeks followed by a break the optimal cycle length is not yet known.
Hovenia dulcis|Hovenia dulcis (Japanese Raisin Tree) is a source of dihydromyricetin (Ampelopsin) and has traditionally been used as an anti-alcohol herb and hangover cure. At least one human study has noted that, when taken before drinking, it can reduce circulating levels of alcohol.
Horse Chestnut|Horse Chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) is a plant extract with a group of molecules known as aescins, which are beneficial to circulatory health. Supplementation of horse chestnut appears to be beneficial for varicose veins and veinous insufficiency.~~~~Caution Notice~~~~It may be possible to be allergic to the β-aescin component of horse chestnut extract
Horny Goat Weed|Epimedium, known as Horny Goat Weed, is an erectile aid and aphrodisiac used in Traditional Chinese Medicine that just so happens to also increase testosterone in research animals (has not been looked at in humans). May also be a cognitive booster and heart health agent.~~~~Horny Goat Weed is a herb (Epimedium) that is known for being an aphrodisiac and touted as a Testosterone Booster. It derives its layman names from goats and sheep who acted a bit more frisky after consuming Epimedium that grew near their fields.~~~~It is also sometimes referred to by its active ingredient, Icariin. Icariin is known as a prenylated flavonoid compound and has been shown to exert much of the aphrodisiac effects of Horny Goat Weed. It has also been shown in one rat study to increase testosterone levels at a rather high dose, and moderate dosages are shown to be beneficial for bone health.~~~~Icariin has not been shown to increase testosterone in females, yet two other compounds in Horny Goat Weed (Icaritin, Desmethylicaritin) have actually increased estrogen in post-menopausal females. The herb acts as an aphrodisiac in both genders, and the gender-specific hormone increasing could be beneficial for both genders.
Hordenine|Hordenine (N,N-dimethyltyramine) is an adrenergic-like compound found in a variety of foods investigated for its fat-burning effects. May be a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor.~~~~Hordenine is a molecule found in a variety of plants alongside other adrenergic amines such as tyramine or synephrine, and has been linked to having adrenergic effects after intravenous administration. Practically, Hordenine is very underresearched and comparative analysis' between other stimulants cannot be conducted right now.~~~~Technically Hordenine can be used as a stimulant and fat burner due to its associated with tyramine and noradrenaline, but not enough evidence exists currently to support its usage as nutritional supplementation.~~~~Hordenine is on the FDA's Dietary Supplement Ingredient Advisory List as of April, 2019. These are ingredients that do not appear to be lawful ingredients in dietary supplements. The list is subject to change (check the provided link for current status).
Hoodia gordonii|Hoodia gordonii is a small shrub (falsely said to be a cactus) that is claimed to suppress appetite. It seems the main bioactive (P57) cannot easily reach the brain to do this, and aside from failures of hoodia to suppress the appetite it may also be mildly toxic and imprudent to supplement.~~~~Hoodia gordonii is a small plant that is used as a famine food (to suppress appetite and thirst, to make suffering a famine a bit more bearable) and due to that is sought after for possible appetite suppressive effects. The first introduction of Hoodia to the first world (Europe and North America) was based on preliminary studies associated with the company producing Hoodia, and the lone independent study on Hoodia has noted that active dose recommended for a supplement not only failed to reduce appetite but was also associated with some mild and irregular toxic effects that need to be further investigated.~~~~This plant appears to be a source of a large amount (well over 30) steroidal glycosides, and only one is said to be the activ ingredient (P57) yet most of the steroidal glycosides have no research on them. Due to this, the possible toxic effects in humans (confirmed in mice), and both the inefficacy on reducing appetite while having no other apparent marketable effects Hoodia gordonii does not appear to hold any promise for a dietary supplement.~~Caution Notice~~~~Possible CYP3A4 inhibition in vitro at a concentration that is relevant; no human studies have yet been conducted
Holy Basil|A traditional anti-fertility agent and libido enhancer in Ayurveda, Holy Basil (also known as Tulsi) is currently being investigated for these two claims and its general health properties. A good source of dietary Ursolic acid, which may cause the anti-fertility aspects.~~~~Holy Basil (also known as Tulsi, or Ocimum sanctum) is an ayurvetic herb which has historically been used to treat a variety of general ailments. It recently has been shown to hold scientific worth in the areas of liver protection and general anti-oxidant activity, as well as being classified as an adaptogen (reducing the effects of stress on the body).~~~~It is also used as a Testosterone Booster, although no direct evidence exists in humans for this. It has also been demonstrated to hinder reproductive capacity.~~~~Caution Notice~~~~Many studies not using an ethanol-extract, suggesting the active ingredients may be fat-soluble in nature~~~~Probably one of the only testosterone boosting compounds (whether it works or not) that hinders spermatogenesis, possibly related to the ursolic acid content
Higenamine|Higenamine (Norcoclaurine) is part of the Nandina plant that has traditionally been used as an anti-asthmatic and is currently used as a fat burner due to sharing similar mechanisms to ephedrine; limited evidence on these claims.~~~~Higenamine is a molecule derived from a variety of fruits and plants that appears to have anti-asthmatic properties via dilating the bronchial tubes (a mechanism known as Beta(2)adrenergic agonism). This mechanism is also the same one underlying the fat burning potential of ephedrine, and as such Higenamine is currently being used as a fat burner.~~~~Currently, there is no human evidence using Higenamine and it appears to be similarly potent to some established beta(2)adrenergic agonists in preliminary studies (in regards to anti-asthmatic effects).~~~~Beyond that mechanism, it may also exert anti-inflammatory effects and injections may be useful in a clinical setting against sepsis.~~~~Higenamine is on the FDA's Dietary Supplement Ingredient Advisory List as of April, 2019. These are ingredients that do not appear to be lawful ingredients in dietary supplements. The list is subject to change (check the provided link for current status).
Hibiscus sabdariffa|Hibiscus Sabdariffa (Roselle or Sour Tea) is a tea where the usually dark colored flowers are used to brew. It appears to inhibit carbohydrate absorption to a degree and appears to be effective in reducing blood pressure.~~~~Hibiscus Sabdariffa (Roselle) is a supplemental herb that is derived from the plant's calyces, which are the collection of sepals separating the blooming flower from the stem. The calyces have traditionally been steeped into tea where the anthocyanins (red-blue pigmentation) is steeped into the water and drank for medicinal purposes.~~~~Although it has a variety of claims medicinally, it appears to have evidence to support its role in reducing blood pressure in persons with elevated blood pressure. It may be this through ACE inhibitory potential (although this is admittedly weak) or benefitting the endothelium via nitric oxide related mechanisms (appears to be in better accordance with the amount of anthocyanins that reach the blood). Reductions in both diastolic and systolic blood pressure have been noted, and for the most part appear to be reliable in presence although not so much in magnitude of benefit (ie. blood pressure is reliably reduced, but the degree of reduction seems to vary).~~~~In regards to diabetes and blood glucose control, Roselle appears to have limited evidence to support these claims but the evidence is so far in support. Mechanisms are not known, and the remarkable potency in animal studies seems to be markedly less in the limited human interventions looking at it. Roselle does appear to weakly inhibit carbohydrate absorption enzymes, yet is synergistic with Morus Alba (White Mulberry) in doing so; a tea made of White Mulberries and Roselle, although currently not supported in vivo, is possibly an effective carbohydrate absorption inhibitory tea.~~~~The interactions of Roselle and weight loss are not too clear-cut, and it seems to be highly intertwined with studies on Roselle toxicity; Roselle is known to be toxic in higher doses, and weight loss more often than not precedes chronic toxicity. For studies that note weight loss without toxicity, it seems to be related to reduced food intake in rats and mice rather than direct fat burning effects.~~~~The appetite suppressing effects seem to be fairly reliable in rats, but caution should be taken in applying these effects to humans. Aside from not being reported as a side-effect in any human study, the bioactive known as Hibiscus Acid is similarly structured to (-)-Hydroxycitric acid from Garcinia Cambogia which is known to reduce appetite in rats reliably but not humans.~~~~Low doses of Roselle tea or supplements appear to be effective in reducing blood pressure, and may be anti-diabetic. It is unlikely that Roselle can cause weight loss independent of a reduction of appetite~~The toxicity itself seems to occur in mice and rats in a similar idea as the blood pressure reducing effects in humans, as in they occur reliably although the dose required to induce toxicity and what exactly occurs seems to vary from one study to another. This may be related to the exact molecules mediating toxicity not being known right now. For the majority of toxic effects, the lowest they have occurred is 200mg/kg in rats (2.2g dried calyx for a 150lb human). Human studies have used this dose or above with no apparent side effects though. The toxicity of these doses of Roselle need to be evaluated more.~~~~One concern that does exist is testicular toxicity, which occurs fairly reliably at 200mg/kg or above in animals but has not been investigated in humans. Roselle appears to be anti-fertility in men, inducing abnormal sperm morphology. In females, there was a series of studies suggesting Roselle could cause abnormal (higher) birth weights in offspring with a delay of pubertal onset; for the most part these are attributed to the appetite suppressing effect causing maternal malnutrition, with no per se mechanisms harming the pup (via lactation) currently known.~~~~Although these toxic effects can possibly be avoided by adhering to proper dosing, the amount of safety information in humans is not as expansive as would be desired; the therapeutic threshold (degree of 'safety buffer' between the active dose and toxic dose) is also lower than desirable, so possible toxic effects with overdosing Roselle is probably more relevant than other supplements.~~~~Higher doses of Roselle do exert toxic effects, although none of these toxic effects have been reported in humans (that being said, they have not conclusively been disproven either). It would be prudent to avoid taking too much Roselle, especially since many benefits of Roselle (elaborating on in complete summary) are not dose-dependent above the lowest observable toxic dose of 2.2g/150lb human
Hibiscus rosasinensis|Hibiscus rosasinensis (China Rose) is a flower that has traditionally been used for hair growth and for the treatment of stomach ulcers. It has general antioxidant properties, but is otherwise underresearched.
Hibiscus macranthus|Hibiscus Macranthus is a herb commonly used alongside the herb Basella Alba in order to promote male fertility and increase testosterone, and this combination therapy has shown benefits in at least one rat study; overall, understudied.
Hesperidin|Hesperidin is a compound in orange peels that gives the flavonoid hesperitin to the body, and this flavonoid mediates most benefits of hesperidin including a possible increase in circulation (but unclear effects on blood pressure) and possible brain protective effects. Hesperidin, alongside naringenin, are known as the main citrus flavonoids.~~~~Hesperidin is a bioflavonoid glycoside commonly found in citrus fruits (most notoriously oranges) and is a sugar-bound form of the flavonoid hesperitin. Hesperitin is known to mediate the actions of hesperidin in the body, and since hesperidin needs to progress to the colon to be 'released' by intestinal bacteria it acts as a time-release for hesperitin; one serving of hesperidin seems to increased blood levels for over the course of a day or so when consumed in this manner.~~~~If we are to look at the human evidence on orally ingested hesperidin, it appears to promote blood flow (minorly to moderately) although it's unclear if it has a notable influence on blood pressure; the current research isn't supportive overall, though it hasn't been studied in severe hypertension yet. It is pretty much ineffective for cholesterol and triglycerides from the available evidence. Not much other human evidence exists aside from the cardiovascular parameters mentioned above, and it seems pretty weak at improving parameters of diabetes as well (with exception to the eyes, diabetic retinopathy, as preliminary evidence suggests that hesperidin is quite protective of them).~~~~That being said, in animal studies oral intake of hesperidin at a dose similar to that used in humans seems to be a very potent cardioprotection agent and is quite protective of the brain in response to various stressors; the protection is antioxidative in nature, but it seems to work through a currently not identified antioxidant responses from the genome. Aside from the protective effects (most notable in the heart and brain, but extend to every organ), hesperidin may be able to reduce a lack of appetite and have minor anti-allergic properties.~~~~Orange peels can actually be used to get the supplemental dosage of hesperidin seen in the human studies, and hesperidin is known to interact with a variety of drug metabolizing enzymes so it should be approached cautiously if also using pharmaceuticals.~~~~Caution Notice~~~~Appears to inhibit CYP3A4 at oral doses which are likely relevant to oral supplementation~~~~Appears to inhibit both CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, whereas only the latter may be relevant due to inhibition of CYP2C8 needing a large concentration to occur~~~~Hesperidin (and orange juice in general) may inhibit the OAT2B1 transporter to a relevant degree
Hemp Protein|Hemp is a food product derived from the same plant of which Marijuana originates from, but without intoxicating components; the protein fragment appears to be a popular meal replacement supplement but is not yet linked to unique properties (relative to other Protein supplements).~~~~Hemp protein is a industrial byproduct from hempseed where the seeds (balanced macronutrient profile) have their oil extracted into Hempseed oil, and the remainding seedmeal that is high in protein relative to the seeds is then processed into Hemp protein supplements.~~~~Hemp that is currently on the market is a strain low in THC (the intoxicant and psychoactive agent in Marijuana) and does not confer intoxicating properties. It is usually not a pure protein supplement, as it has up to 10% fatty acids by weight (pretty balanced between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and generally high in polyunsaturated fatty acids) and confers a higher inherent fiber content relative to other Protein supplements. The protein portion of hemp is not a complete protein source, due to being low in Lysine (the rate limiting essential amino acid); it is also relatively low in leucine, but is relatively high in both L-Tyrosine and Arginine.~~~~There is a cannabinoid content in Hemp, although they are cannabinoids that do not interact with the two classical cannabinoid receptors in the human body and are unlikely to have the same neural properties attributed to marijuana. These may confer some health properties unique to hemp products (either hempseed protein or Marijuana) but in the context of using hemp protein as a meal replacement they are not studied.~~~~Currently, hemp protein appears to be a viable meal replacement option and has the benefit of having a higher fiber content but is not yet linked to unique health benefits (or harms) to establish its importance over other dietary sources of protein.~~~~Caution Notice~~~~There is a low THC content in hemp protein and supplementing the protein will likely not confer any intoxicating properties~~~~Hemp protein is known to not have the most desirable taste. It may be prudent to taste hemp first (via free samples or a friend) before making a purchasing decision
Hederagenin|Hederagenin is a triterpenoid saponin similar to ones like ursolic acid, and is found in high levels in foods such as quinoa.
Harpagophytum procumbens|Harpagophytum Procumbens (Devil's Claw) is a tuber that has traditional usage for musculoskeletal disorders, pain relief, and appetite stimulation; it appears to have preliminary evidence for its benefits to osteoarthritis and pain.~~~~Harpagophytum Procumbens (commonly called Devil's Claw) is a tuber vegetable that is used for combatting lower back pain as well as arthritis (both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis). It appears to have efficacy at this, and may take a few months to reach maximal efficacy (so it would be unlikely something like Aspirin, which acts fairly fast).~~~~Human trials have been conducted on Devil's Claw and arthritis, and although there appear to be a large amount of trials conducted on it many are not sourced online or in Medline (instead mentioned vicariously through systemic reviews and meta-analysis' on the subject) and the power of these trials are limited, due to sample sizes and lack of control for the most part. That being said, at least two well controlled trials note that the efficacy of Devil's Claw is greater than placebo with one saying it is of similar potency to Vioxx (Rofecoxib, a COX2 inhibitor and antiinflammatory).~~~~Not too much research into other effects of Devil's Claw, although one study suggests it has remarkable anticholesterase inhibitory potential with the potency on butrylcholinesterase (a cholinesterase enzyme found in the blood and liver) being greater than Galantamine.~~~~There appears to be much discussion on safety of Devil's Claw, which may have stemmed from traditional users of Devil's Claw warning about excessive usage. In short term trials it appears to be well tolerated, with a lack of long term evidence. It is definitely possible that it may induce uterine contractions when taken orally, and due to this it should not be used by pregnant women.
HMB|HMB is an active metabolite of leucine that reduces muscle protein breakdown. It appears to have an anticatabolic role for muscle, but fails to be more effective than its parent amino acid for inducing muscle protein synthesis.~~~~HMB (short for β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate) is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine that, along with KIC (α keto-isocaproate) and isovaleryl-CoA, mediate the effects of leucine. Approximately 5% of dietary leucine is oxidized into HMB, and HMB appears to be the main metabolite of leucine that more effectively prevents the breakdown of muscle protein.~~~~When compared to leucine, HMB appears to be significantly more potent on a gram per gram basis at attenuating the rate of muscle protein breakdown but is less effective than leucine at inducing muscle protein synthesis. Due to this, HMB is marketed as an anti-catabolic agent (purposed to reduce the rate of muscle breakdown) rather than an anabolic agent (purposed to increase muscle mass).~~~~Human trials don't normally tend to be structured to properly assess the effects of HMB, as most of the studies are a standard diet paired with an exercise regimen investigating the role of HMB in promoting muscle protein synthesis (of which it is similar to leucine in the sense that there are positive results, but quite unreliably so); the limited evidence that assesses HMB during periods of muscle loss are either underpowered or not in athletes.~~~~HMB, currently, appears to be a pretty interesting supplement for the purpose of reducing muscle wasting during periods where muscle atrophy is accelerated (cachexia, AIDS, bedrest) and should theoretically work in athletes on a calorie restricted diet but is not fully established for this role yet (which is a notable issue, since glutamine has a large dichotomy between clinical and healthy populations).
Gynostemma pentaphyllum|Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Southern Ginseng) is a herb given Ginseng status although not related to Panax Ginseng. It appears to share some saponins though, and is investigated for similar effects as True Ginseng.~~~~Gynostemma Pentaphyllum is a plant which is sometimes referred to as either 'Southern Ginseng' or 'Cheap Ginseng' as it was used as a cheap substitute for Panax Ginseng (as aside from Codonopsis Pilosula, which was used as an adulterant for Panax Ginseng to sell it at the normal price but cut costs). Surprisingly, Gynostemma has a good content of Ginsenosides that were once thought to be wholly unique to Panax Ginseng. As such, the biological effects of Gynostemma and Panax seem to be quite similar except Gynostemma may be more anti-diabetic (due to the unique Gypenosides in Gynostemma, that are not in Panax).~~~~There are limited human studies at the moment, as most studies are attempting to delineate the large amount of Gypenosides in this herb to see which ones can be seen as the 'active' compounds. Currently, we have two human studies suggesting that a tea made from Gynostemma can be used alongside standard anti-diabetic therapy and augment the efficacy of it over time (known as adjunct therapy).~~~~Most of its 'beneficial' effects beyond the diabetic effects (which are mediated by a possible mix of AMPK activation and PTP1B inhibition; the amount each contributes to the overall effects unknown) come from inducing antioxidant enzymes and protecting cells from oxidative damage over time. There seems to be a motif where preloading and chronic loading is very protective at low doses, and acute supplementation or rehabilitation (taking the supplement after the stressor) appears to be less effective. As such, the health effects of Gynostemma Pentaphyllum appear to be more prophylactic rather than rehabilitative or therapeutic.~~~~This herb is also touted for youthfulness and longevity, but neither claim has been explored. Additionally, the anti-cancer effects are still in beginning stages of research but the effects appear to be very similar in many cell lines; some compound in the Gypenoside fragment may be an inducer of p53, a tumor suppressor gene, as the downstream events associated with p53 activity have been noted repeatedly (although direct kinetics between Gypenosides and p53 have not yet been investigated; this is a likely theory but not established)~~~~Overall, this is a more anti-diabetic Panax Ginseng; the downside is that the other benefits associated with Panax Ginseng (adaptogenic, cognitive enhancing, anti-fatigue) have not yet been assessed properly with Gynostemma Pentaphyllum.
Guggul|Guggul is a product of the Guggul tree, Commiphora Mukul. Guggul and its active guggulsterones have been investigated for their usage in elevating thyroid function, but with lacklustre results.~~~~Guggul is a plant which is known for its active ingredients, the guggulsterones. It has been traditionally used for combatting ailments such as high blood lipids, liver dysfunction and obesity.~~~~Its most well marketed effect, that of being able to increase thyroid activity, does not occur with doses commonly found in supplements. It does, however, exert an anti-cholesterolemic effect (lowers blood cholesterol levels) and is also an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant compound.~~~~It is a healthy compound, but not effective for the main means it is marketed for (fat loss).~~~~Caution Notice~~~~The plant guggul had both water soluble and fat soluble fragments; the active guggulsterones are fat soluble.~~~~'Dermatological Hypersensitivity' (adverse skin reactions) have been associated with Guggul and Guggulipid consumption
Griffonia simplicifolia|Griffonia simplicifolia is an African shrub and a source of the compound 5-HTP. It has anxiety and appetite-reducing effects.~~~~Griffonia simplicifolia is a West African shrub. Griffonia simplicifolia is the largest source of the compound 5-HTP. Its seeds contain up to 20% 5-HTP, by weight.~~~~Studies that have been done on Griffonia simplicifolia suggest that when supplemented as an herb, it may rival the effects of supplementing 5-HTP in isolation.~~~~However, further research is needed to confirm this effect. There may be other bioactives in the plant that are still undiscovered.~~~~Additional studies are needed to determine whether supplementing Griffonia simplicifolia is truly comparable to supplementing 5-HTP.~~~~How to Take Griffonia simplicifolia~~~~Further research is needed to determine the optimal human dose of Griffonia simplicifolia. The lowest effect dose for rats is 25mg/kg of bodyweight, which is about 4mg/kg of Griffonia simplicifolia extract, assuming 20% 5-HTP content. This translates to following human doses:~~~~• 275mg Griffonia(55mg of 5-HTP) for a 150lb person~~~~• 350mg Griffonia (70mg of 5-HTP) for a 200lb person~~~~• 450mg Griffonia (90mg of 5-HTP) for a 250lb person~~~~It is unknown whether Griffonia simplicifolia has other bioactives other than 5-HTP. The human dosages listed above are derived from rodent studies, and are not optimal, which is why they are different from the optimal dose of 5-HTP.
Green Tea Catechins|Green tea catechins are four molecules, high amounts of which are present in green tea and other sources. The most potent one is EGCG. It is effective in respect to most claims and potent in a few. Any fat burning benefits are dependent on being caffeine naive.~~~~Green tea (Camellia Sinensis) is a plant frequently steeped in hot water and drunk as tea. It exerts most of its benefits through water-soluble polyphenols (frequently referred to as catechins) extracted from the leaves, into water, which is then consumed.~~~~It has been implicated in benefiting almost every organ system in the body. It is cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-obesity, anti-carcinogenic, anti-diabetic, anti-artherogenic, liver protective and beneficial for blood vessel health. These beneficial effects are seen in doses present both in green tea itself (as a drink) as well as from a supplemental form.~~~~Caution Notice~~~~Green tea can be stimulatory~~~~If steeped too long, green tea can possess a very bitter taste due to its tannin content. Tannins may not be bad inherently, but the taste is sometimes seen as a turn-off.~~~~'Green tea extract' in pills, unless processing is specified, can be as simple as a capsule of tea leaves. There is little to no difference between tea in liquid form and capsules, aside from possibly dosage and taste.~~~~Although milk proteins can form complexes with green tea catechins (which makes them temporarily indigestible), these complexes are digested and the green tea is released in the intestines, so it may be absorbed. ~~~~Most doses are standardized against EGCG. Although the amount of EGCG-equivalent varies from one cup of tea to another, depending on many factors (species of tea, length of steeping, time spent oxidizing), one cup of camellia sinensis green tea contains approximately 50mg of EGCG-equivalent.~~~~Fat burning:~~~~The benefits of green tea catechins on lipid oxidation and related fat-burning pathways are achieved in a dose dependent manner. Significant effects in humans are noted only at high doses, such as 400-500mg EGCG equivalent per day (most Green Tea Extract supplements are roughly 50% EGCG). Fat burning effects are highly synergistic, almost dependent, on not consuming caffeine habitually.~~~~Cancer Prevention:~~~~Cancer prevention effects are quite dose-dependent, and would be better to consume all catechins (as green tea extract) rather than isolated EGCG. Minimal doses would be good (200mg or higher) but with more frequency (3+ times a day). High, frequent doses may make one prone to nausea
Green Coffee Extract|Green Coffee Extract is a concentrated source of dietary Chlorogenic Acid and is currently being used for heart health and fat loss as a supplement; it seems weakly to moderately effective on these parameters.~~~~Green Coffee extract is a supplement and/or food product that is derived from Green Coffee Beans. For all intents and purposes, it has similar chemical composition to coffee beans in general but has a much higher content of molecules known as Chlorogenic Acid; a term used to refer to molecules that have small phenolics bound to a Quinic acid group.~~~~The Chlorogenic Acids in Green Coffee Extract are readily absorbed, and they themselves or their metabolites (such as ferulic acid) mediate many of the benefits of Green Coffee Extract. Supplementing Chlorogenic Acid should also, theoretically, confer much of the same benefits as Green Coffee Extract (and vice versa).~~~~Oral ingestion of Green Coffee Extract may weakly reduce body weight in overweight and obese persons (mechanisms currently unknown, thought to be related to preventing carbohydrate uptake from the intestines after a meal) although the degree of weight reduction seems quite unreliable at this moment in time; studies in lean persons are nonexistent right now. A handful of studies suggest that 'blood health' can be improved via increase vasoreactivity and lowered blood pressure, which have been shown to benefit people with poor vascular function or high blood pressure; this may only be a bandaid effect (with one study noting that 2 weeks after cessation the beneficial changes were being normalized) and may be due to the ferulic acid metabolite.~~~~Green Coffee Extract is indeed healthy, but for the benefits it is touted for it does not appear to be as potent as some other supplements.~~~~Studies using Green Coffee Extract (GCE) tend to be dosed based on their chlorogenic acid content, which in isolation are taken in the 120-300mg range. Based on this, recommended intakes of GCE would be approximately:~~~~1,200-3,000mg for a 10% chlorogenic acid supplement~~~~600-1,500mg for a 20% chlorogenic acid supplement~~~~240-600mg for a 50% chlorogenic acid supplement~~~~The optimal dosage of both GCE and isolated chlorogenic acid is not known at this moment in time.
Grapefruit|Grapefruit is a food product known for having a high level of bioactives, similar to the pomegranate. It does appear to be effective at reducing fat mass when a mixture of polyphenols are used, and may work nicely with caffeine.~~~~Studies that use the grapefruit itself (whole fruit) tend to use one half of a grapefruit at 2-3 meals throughout the day.
Grape Seed Extract|Grape Seed Extract is a mixture of tannins and procyanidins (chains of catechins) that appears to exert anti-estrogenic effects and may enhance blood flow. More related to green tea catechins than to resveratrol mechanistically.~~~~Studies conducted in humans used in the range of 150-300mg Grape Seed extract daily for heart health purposes, while doses up to 600mg have been used with no reported side effects.
Glycine|Glycine is an amino acid and neurotransmitter. It can play both stimulatory and depressant roles in the brain. Supplementation can improve sleep quality.~~~~For glycemic and sleep benefits, doses of 3-5 grams with meals and before bed, respectively, have been used successfully in clinical research.
Gluten|Gluten is a protein found in wheat and related grain products. It is involved in the rising of baked goods. People with celiac disease should not consume gluten, and it may also cause issues for people with other intestinal disorders. There is not much evidence to support the idea that gluten damages healthy intestinal tracts.~~~~A lot of the research on gluten is done in the context of celiac disease (CD), a genetic autoimmune disease characterized by intestinal damage and an increased immune response as a result of gliadin consumption, a component of gluten. People with CD should avoid gluten to avoid this damage. Untreated CD combined with continued gluten intake is associated with a greater risk of death. People without CD or people with CD that also avoid gluten do not experience this increased risk.~~~~Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is another big topic for gluten researchers. There is some evidence to suggest people with non-celiac intestinal disorders like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are more likely to experience flatulence, pain, and nausea after consuming gluten than people with healthy intestinal tracts. However, people with NCGS do not experience the same level of damage after eating gluten than people with CD. So, the discomfort of people with NCGS may be better explained by other carbohydrates associated with gluten, rather than autoimmune damage. Researchers examining self-diagnosis of gluten sensitivity suggest that many people with NCGS do not actually display any sensitivity and the symptoms may be the result of discussions related to gluten causing intestinal problems, also known as a 'nocebo' effect.~~~~People with CD should avoid gluten at all costs, while people with other intestinal disorders may experience mild to severe discomfort after gluten consumption, possibly due to wheat's ability to produce gas. There is currently no evidence that gluten causes tissue damage when consumed by people without CD.~~~~Gluten is not a supplement and does not provide benefits to the body after ingestion. Supplementing gluten is not recommended. People with celiac disease should not consume gluten.~~~~Can autism be helped by gluten-free, casein-free diets?~~Gluten and casein are two food components thought to exacerbate autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms. But when diets free of gluten and casein are analyzed in rigorously controlled trials, no improvements are seen in ASD behavior outcomes.
Glutathione|Glutathione is an antioxidant used by every cell and tissue in the body. Although critical for a number of processes, it has limited use as dietary supplement due to rapid breakdown during oral ingestion. Its metabolite, L-cysteine, can increase glutathione in the body but consuming L-cysteine via glutathione is inefficient and costly.~~~~Glutathione (γ-L-Glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) is a small amino acid containing molecule (peptide) comprised of one molecule of L-glutamic acid, L-cysteine, and Glycine each. The molecule is found in the food supply and in the human body where it acts as an antioxidant. The 'glutathione system' comprises the enzymes that synthesize glutathione within a cell as well as dedicated enzymes that use glutathione as the means to exert antioxidant effects. Supplementation of glutathione is thought to support this pool of glutathione in a cell and thus maintain the efficacy of the entire glutathione system. Despite the pervasive role of glutathione in cell biology, it currently has a limited role in nutritional supplementation due to the following pharmacokinetic properties:~~~~There may be some absorption of glutathione intact from the intestines, but it cannot enter cells intact. It must be metabolized to form L-cystine (two molecules of L-cysteine bound together) before being taken up.~~~~Provision of L-cysteine within the cell is all that is needed to increase glutathione synthesis, and N-Acetylcysteine does this efficiently at a lower financial cost than glutathione.~~~~In effect, glutathione is an indirect and expensive way to provide dietary L-cysteine. Dietary protein itself, including L-cysteine rich sources such as Whey Protein, are effective but inefficient ways to increase L-cysteine intake in the diet and N-Acetylcysteine is both more efficient and cheaper than glutathione.~~~~Although oral glutathione supplementation does not efficiently increase intracellular glutathione levels for the above reasons, it can be absorbed intact into the blood stream. Since increased glutathione levels in the blood have been shown to slow the breakdown of nitric oxide, glutathione supplementation may be useful to augment nitric oxide boosters such as L-Citrulline or L-Arginine.
Glutamine|A conditionally essential amino acid which only appears to benefit the body as supplementation when otherwise deficient (vegans, vegetarians with low dairy intake) or during prolonged endurance exercise. Anecdotally reported to reduce sugar cravings.~~~~Glutamine is one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids in dietary protein, specifically it is a conditionally essential amino acid (being elevated to essential during periods of disease and muscle wasting typical of physical trauma). It is sold as an isolated amino acids as well as being found in high levels in dietary meats and eggs. It is found in very high levels in both whey and casein protein.~~~~Glutamine is a very effective intestinal and immune system health compound, as these cells use glutamine as the preferred fuel source rather than glucose.~~~~It is generally touted as a muscle builder, but has not been proven to enhance muscle building in healthy individuals; only those suffering from physical trauma such as burns or muscular wounds (knife wounds) or in disease states in which muscle wasting occurs, such as AIDS. In these individuals, however, glutamine is effective at building muscle and alleviating a decrease in muscle mass typical of the ailment.~~~~Supplementation of L-glutamine tends to be dosed at 5 g or above, with higher doses being advised against due to excessive ammonia in serum. The lowest dose found to increase ammonia in serum has been 0.75 g/kg, or approximately 51 g for a 150 lb individual.~~~~Due to the relative inefficacy of glutamine supplementation for increasing muscle mass, the optimal dosage is not known. The above recommended doses are sufficient for intestinal health reasons and for attenuating a possible relative glutamine deficiency (seen in instances of low protein intake or veganism).
Glucuronolactone|Glucuronolactone is a molecule commonly found as a component of energy drink formulations with surprisingly minimal research on it, given its societal usage.
Glucosamine|Glucosamine is a supplement derived from shellfish that can provide minor pain relief. Glucosamine sulfate slightly delays the progression of knee osteoarthritis.~~~~Glucosamine is a supplement derived from shellfish.~~~~Glucosamine is primarily sold as a joint health supplement. Studies show that supplementing glucosamine sulfate will reduce the rate of collagen (joint tissue) degradation and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Though glucosamine is comparable to acetaminophen, the reference drug for osteoarthritis, in potency, it is not as reliable.~~~~Studies on athletes supplementing glucosamine are limited, but preliminary evidence suggests doses as high as 3,000mg of glucosamine sulfate may be able to slow joint degradation. This effect is most relevant for athletes participating in high impact sports, like running.~~~~Though preliminary evidence suggested glucosamine supplementation could cause insulin resistance, follow up studies conclude that glucosamine supplementation does not affect glucose metabolism.~~~~Glucosamine is very safe to supplement and its most common side-effect is flatulence. Glucosamine supplementation cannot cure osteoarthritis, but it can slow the progression of the disease.~~~~Caution Notice~~~~Although there does not appear to be a large adverse interaction between glucosamine and diabetes (some schools of thought believe that glucosamine induces insulin resistance, which doesn't appear to be that reliable in humans after oral ingestion) it still seems to be prudent to ask a medical doctor about using glucosamine if one is pre-diabetic or diabetic~~~~Although glucosamine per se is not allergenic, other bioactives from its source (shellfish) may be found in some dietary supplements and thus persons with shellfish allergies should take caution in using glucosamine supplementation
Ginkgo biloba|Ginkgo biloba is the most commonly ingested herb for brain health. While it may boost cognition in older populations, this effect is not very reliable or generalizable.~~~~Gingko biloba can be supplemented for cognitive enhancement, or to alleviate cognitive decline.~~~~For cognitive enhancement, take 120-240mg, one to four hours before performance. To alleviate cognitive decline in older adults, take 40-120mg, three times a day.~~~~The supplement form of Gingko biloba is also called EGb-761 extract. It should be a 50:1 concentrated extract.~~~~Gingko biloba should be taken with meals.
Ginger|Ginger is a spice that has traditionally been treated as medicine in both Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda, doses of 1-3g can reduce nausea and ease digestion quite effectively; superloading the powdered rhizome (vertical root) at 10-15g daily might increase testosterone.~~~~Caution Notice~~~~The scent of ginger may confer some pain relief effects. One study conducted comparing massage against massage + ginger scent noted significant differences 1 week after the trial started, but the differences evened out after 4 weeks.~~~~It has been scientifically established, through ginger, that chewing your food is a good idea
Garlic|Garlic (Allium sativum) is a food product that can improve immunity and cardiovascular health.~~~~Garlic (Allium sativum) is a popular vegetable with a variety of medicinal properties.~~~~Taking or eating garlic can benefit cardiovascular health, physical and sexual vitality, cognition, and resistance to infection. It also has anti-aging properties.~~~~Raw or aged garlic reliably reduces total cholesterol and Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL-C), while increasing High-density Lipoprotein (HDL-C). Garlic also provides a variety of anti-cancer properties. Eating garlic daily (10g or more) is associated with a significantly reduced risk of prostate, colon, and stomach cancer. It can also induce fat loss and adrenaline secretion, though in a minor way. Garlic appears to mildly and unreliably reduce triglyceride levels.~~~~Garlic’s main mechanism involves a molecule called alliin. When garlic is physically disturbed through chewing, slicing, or crushing, it releases an alliin metabolite: allicin. Allicin turns into a variety of fat and water soluble sulfur-containing compounds. In fact, these compounds are so volatile, they give off hydrogen sulfide, which is part of garlic’s unmistakable smell and taste. By tapping into the hydrogen sulfide signaling system, garlic relaxes the blood vessels and provides a variety of health benefits. Garlic also uses the hydrogen sulfide signaling system to exert its anti-cancer effects.~~~~Garlic can be taken in several forms: fresh/raw garlic, aged garlic, garlic oil and boiled garlic. Boiled garlic prevents alliin from creating its sulfur-containing metabolites, and garlic oil, while effective as a supplement, has a potentially high level of toxicity. All of the beneficial components of garlic can be found in fresh garlic, which makes aged garlic supplements and fresh garlic the two best ways to supplement garlic. Garlic should be crushed, sliced, or chewed (prior to cooking) in order to ensure maximum allicin production, since allicin is responsible for many of garlic’s beneficial effects.~~Caution Notice~~The lowest estimated 'toxic' dose associated with raw garlic consumption has been noted to be a human equivalent of 400mg/kg (or 25g of raw garlic), which resulted in testicular toxicity~~~~It is possible to be allergic to garlic supplements, if you are allergic to garlic itself~~~~8g (about two large cloves) of garlic can cut blood levels of Saquinavir in half~~~~While moderate dietary intake of garlic does not reduce platelet aggregation or adversely interact with Warfarin, higher doses (2,400-7,200mg of Aged Garlic Extract) may do so~~~~Contrary to popular belief, garlic may attract vampires
Garcinia cambogia|Garcinia Cambogia is a fruit that is known to enhance the culinary experience of food, and enhances satiety from a meal (possibly by enhancing the flavor experience). Its usage as a fat burner does not appear to extend to humans.~~~~Garcinia Cambogia (Malabar Tamarind) is a small fruit that has some traditional usage to enhance the culinary experience of a meal, but beyond that has limited medicinal usage. It is a very good source of hydroxycitric acids (structurally related to citric acid, a sour flavorant) and one of the isomers, known as (-)-Hydroxycitric acid, is thought to help in weight control.~~~~The mechanism of action is inhibiting an enzyme called Citric acid lysase which is required in the synthesis of fatty acids, known as de novo lipogenesis. At least in rats, evidence of suppressed de novo lipogenesis has been noted and oral consumption of (-)-Hydroxycitric acid appears to reliably reduce food intake and body weight (the latter to a degree where food intake cannot explain all the observed effects)~~~~Studies in humans, for the most part, fail to replicate this; this may be related to less actual activity of de novo lipogenesis in humans and a much higher level in rats. Some isolated studies do note weight loss, but it appears to be quite variable and unreliable. Many studies also do report subjective appetite decrease, but tend to record dropout rates (how often people leave the study due to being unable to maintain the diet protocol) rather than food intake; even then the benefits are still unreliable and sometimes not present.~~~~Although there is some limited potential for (-)-Hydroxycitric acid as a weight loss aid, the magnitude of effect is quite low (up to 2kg over 3 months) and the benefit is unreliable; making it hard to recommend this compound as a fat burner or anti-obesity agent.
Ganoderma lucidum|Ganoderma lucidum is a potent immune system regulator, promising anti-cancer agent, and stress reducer. This mushroom is frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine.~~~~Ganoderma lucidum, commonly known as the lingzi mushroom, is frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its popularity extends to Japanese and Korean medicine, and it has been making its way west.~~~~Ganoderma lucidum has anti-oxidative effects when supplemented. It also has a therapeutic effect on insulin resistance, reduces the risk of prostate cancer, and can help treat a variety of conditions associated with metabolic syndrome.~~~~The lingzi mushroom is well known for its anti-cancer effects. It is able to activate natural killer cells, increasing their activity and the body’s ability to fight tumors. Supplementing Ganoderma lucidum reduces the chances of metastasis, which is when cancer spreads to another part of the body.~~~~Ganoderma lucidum has a variety of mechanisms, but they are focused on moderating the immune system. The lingzi mushroom is able to reduce immune system activity when the system is overstimulated, and bolster the immune system when it is weakened. In general, Ganoderma lucidum increases the amount of active immune system cells.~~~~Though further research is needed to confirm these effects, Ganoderma lucidum shows promise for a wide variety of cancer-related therapies. It has been shown to be an effective adjunct therapy, which means it improves health when taken alongside other medications, for breast cancer, hepatitis, fatigue syndrome, and prostate cancer. There are not many promising supplements with anti-cancer properties available over-the-counter but Ganoderma lucidum appears to be one of them.~~~~Caution Notice~~~~Ganoderma has a large amount of bioactive molecules, and there is no single 'one' molecule in this mushroom that can be said to be the main bioactive~~~~Polysaccharide compounds (carbohydrates and fiber) tend to be found in the water-soluble fragment, or the hot-water extracts; triterpenoids are found in ethanolic extracts as they are fat soluble~~~~Polysaccharides, or water-soluble extracts, do not need to be taken with food; it would be prudent to take any ethanolic extract with food however~~~~Some effects, such as improving sleep and decreasing symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome, are not acute; sleep improvements are seen after 3 days whereas aid in chronic fatigue may take more than 4 weeks
Gamma Oryzanol|Gamma Oryzanol (γ-Oryzanol), a mixture of compounds found notably in rice bran oil, is a promising but unproven cholesterol-lowering agent with some skin health properties. It does not increase testosterone.
GABA|GABA is the 'downer' neurotransmitter that counters glutamate (upper), as the two mediate brain activation in a Ying:Yang manner. Highly important in the brain, oral ingestion of GABA is complex due to its difficulty in crossing the blood brain barrier.~~~~GABA is the most potent depressive neuroamine in human brains. It regulates many of the depressive and sedative actions in brain tissue and is critical for relaxation.~~~~GABA is a highly regulated compound in vivo (in living), and is able to balance itself out in body tissues due to a myriad of factors.~~~~Due to these regulation factors, GABA as a supplement does not exert many depressive effects on its own. The human body is too adept at regulation, and orally ingested GABA cannot alter human physiology to much of a degree.~~~~GABA, however, is a target for many other compounds that can act vicariously (in a multitude of ways) to increase GABA levels, which ultimately causes depressive effects.~~~~GABA is a depressive neurotransmitter, but supplementation with GABA does not seem to exert depressive effects unless overdosed to an inadvisable level.
Fucoxanthin|Fucoxanthin is a carotenoid found in brown seaweed that is being investigated for its fat burning abilities. It reduces fat mass, but has a time delay due to build up in fat tissue and does not stimulate the brain. Also appears healthy, but needs more corroborating evidence.~~~~Fucoxanthin is a brown seaweed pigment that is found in most brown seaweeds, as well as a few other marine sources. It is a xanthophyll, which is a molecule structurally similar to beta-carotene and vitamin A; yet fucoxanthin does not possess vitamin-like activity in the body.~~~~Fucoxanthin, via its metabolites, seems to be stored in fat cells for a prolonged period of time and can induce fat loss while inhibiting fat cell differentiation and proliferation. Although only one human study has been published, it appears to be a promising non-stimulatory fat loss agent but requires time to work (5-16 weeks).~~~~It also possesses other health benefits, such as correcting abnormalities in glucose metabolism in muscle tissue which can help diabetics and might reduce cholesterol levels and triglycerides by currently unverified mechanisms. Reductions in blood pressure and reductions in both liver fat stores and liver enzyme values have been noted with fucoxanthin supplementation in humans.~~~~Fucoxanthin, although usage as a supplement is preliminary, appears to be a very promising joint fat loss and health boosting agent.
Folic Acid|Folic acid, the synthetic form of folate, is an essential B-vitamin most well known for its role in preventing neural tube defects in infants. It also has a role in supporting general health but may be detrimental in high amounts.~~~~Folate is the essential vitamin sometimes referred to as Vitamin B9, but more commonly known by its synthetic supplemental form 'folic acid'. Found in low levels across most food products of plant origin and found in enhanced levels in some nation's wheat grain due to fortification, folic acid is a vitamin that has essential roles in the growth of neonates as well as in supporting a process known as methylation in adults.~~~~Folic acid is primarily known as being the 'pregnancy supplement' where women who are planning to conceive children take 400 μg folic acid daily. This is critical in preventing something known as 'neural tube defects' (NTDs) which are caused by insufficient folate provision to the fetus when their neural tube is being formed and the combination of food fortification and supplementation has greatly prevented.~~~~Beyond that, folate and folic acid are used to support methylation in the body. These two supplements, due to eventually forming a molecule known as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF or L-methylfolate) are involved in indirectly supporting and creating S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAMe) in the body. Due to this, these supplements tend to show quite a bit of similarity to SAMe supplementation and some parallel to supplements involved in the alternate pathway which support SAMe levels (of which supplements like creatine and trimethylglycine (TMG) are implicated in). These parallels are best demonstrated in their effects on depression where they all seem to be implicated in supporting serotonin-based medication (SSRIs usually) as adjuvant with a trend to benefit women more than men.~~~~Despite these benefits, folic acid is unlike other B-vitamins where it does appear to have a potential side-effect when taken in high doses. While taking a very large dose of folic acid several thousand times the RDA will not cause immediate harm it appears that prolonged exposure to levels up to 250% the RDA may be associated with a relative increase in the rates of cancer, particularly colon cancer among the elderly; well demonstrated by acute increases in the rates of colon cancer when both Canada and the US introduced fortification (the rates, of which, have been declining beforehand and ever since). Among the B-vitamins, folate seems to be the one where a balance should be strived in your everyday life and high sources of supplemental folate should be avoided if not intended for other purposes.~~~~Finally, supplements tend to be in one of three forms; folate, folic acid, and L-methylfolate. Of these supplements folic acid is the most common but is thought to be negative when overconsumed. L-methylfolate seems the most promising as many people seem to have genetic mutations in the enzyme which produces L-methylfolate from folate and folic acid, so supplementing the latter two only causes a partial backlog in these people whereas supplementing L-methylfolate may circumvent this genetically disadvantageous rate-limiting step. Furthermore, L-methylfolate seems to be the most promising agent to support SAMe levels as SAMe, as a supplement, is quite expensive and this pathway tends to take on more of the workload than the one creatine and TMG are implicated in.
Fish Oil|Fish oil is a a source of omega-3 fatty acids. It reduces triglycerides, but does not seem to affect the rate of cardiovascular events. It seems to notably reduce the symptoms of depression and improve some painful, inflammatory conditions.~~~~What is fish oil?~~Fish oil is a common term used to refer to two kinds of omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These omega-3 fats are usually found in fish, animal products, and phytoplankton.~~~~The fatty acids EPA and DHA are involved in regulating various biological processes such as the inflammatory response, various metabolic signaling pathways, and brain function. They can be synthesized in the body from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), but in small amounts for most people.~~~~~~What are fish oil's benefits?~~Fish oil causes a potent reduction in triglyceride levels and a more modest reduction in blood pressure in hypertensives. Despite this, long-term trials haven't found a reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events.~~~~It appears to notably improve mood in people with major depression, though it's unclear if it has an effect in people with minor depression. EPA, in particular, seems to be the most effective omega-3 fatty acid for this purpose which suggests that the effects of fish oil are due to reducing neuroinflammation. Its anti-inflammatory benefits also seem to extend to reducing the symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus. However, its benefits shouldn't be assumed to extend to inflammatory diseases in general.~~~~~~What are fish oil's side effects and drawbacks?~~Many fish oil supplements may contain harmful lipid peroxides (oxidized lipids that can damage cells), but it's unclear if this has notable consequences to health.~~~~~~What is the difference between fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids?~~"Fish oil" refers to a solution of fatty acids where the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are dominant. Fish is by far the most common source for fish oil, hence the name, but an artificially manufactured EPA/DHA dominant mixture from any source could be considered fish oil. Typical fish oil can contain small amounts of other omega-3 fatty acids, usually DPA and fatty acids that don't belong to the omega-3 category. Alpha-linolenic acid (found most abundantly in nuts and seeds), is an omega-3 fatty acid that can be turned into EPA and DHA but is not itself a fish oil fatty acid.
Feverfew|Feverfew is an herb with anti-inflammatory properties used to prevent migraines. It is also claimed to alleviate arthritis, but more research is needed to confirm this effect.~~~~Feverfew, also known as medieval aspirin or wild chamomile, is an herb with anti-inflammatory properties.~~~~Feverfew is most often used to prevent migraines. Feverfew’s effect increases in strength for the first 12 weeks of supplementation, at which point it can be taken indefinitely. Feverfew appears to be effective at reducing the severity and frequency of migraines when supplemented in this way. Limited evidence suggests feverfew supplementation may also reduce the length of a migraine and alleviate the increased sensory sensitivity that occurs during a migraine.~~~~Traditionally, feverfew has been used to alleviate arthritis and inflammation. In vitro evidence suggests that feverfew is a very potent anti-inflammatory herb, but limited human evidence suggests supplementation has no effect on rheumatoid arthritis.~~~~The active compound in feverfew is called parthenolide. It is responsible for feverfew’s anti-inflammatory effects, and it may also have a potent anti-cancer mechanism. Since no human studies have investigated feverfew in the context of cancer, more research is needed to confirm this effect.~~~~Feverfew is safe to supplement, but topical application may result in an allergic reaction. If feverfew supplementation results in reddening or scaly skin, cease supplementation. Pregnant women should not supplement feverfew.~~~~The standard adult dose for feverfew supplementation is 100-300 mg of a feverfew supplement containing 0.2%-0.4% parthenolide, taken one to four times a day.~~~~Children younger than two should not be given feverfew. The standard feverfew dose for children is based off of a standard adult weight of 150 lbs. For example, if a child weighs 50lbs, the dose is one-third of the adult dose.~~~~Liquid and tincture feverfew supplements are sometimes used to alleviate arthritis. The suggested dose is 60 – 120 drops of 1:1 (fluid) supplement or a 1:5 (tincture) supplement, taken twice a day.
Ferula asafoetida|Ferula foetida (the active oleoresin being called Ferula asafoetida) is a supplement catered towards lung and gastrointestinal health, and is used as a carminative agent. It may also have benefits to cognition and usage as an aphrodisiac.~~~~Supplementation in rats tend to use 200-400mg/kg of the gum or oleoresin, which leads to an estimated human dosage of:~~~~2,200-4,400mg for a 150lb person~~~~2,900-5,800mg for a 200lb person~~~~3,600-7,300mg for a 250lb person~~~~These are estimated human dosages based on the animal research, and it is not known if they are the optimal human doses or not.
Fenugreek|Fenugreek is a plant supplemented for its libido enhancing and anti-diabetic effects.~~~~Trigonella foenum-graecum, commonly known as fenugreek, is a popular herb in Arabic regions and India. It has traditionally been used to enhance libido and masculinity.~~~~Fenugreek has also been used to alleviate blood sugar metabolism problems like diabetes.~~~~Fenugreek tea has also been recommended to new mothers to enhance milk production. Though evidence for this claim is limited, it seems to be accurate. One human study has shown that fenugreek supplementation can also enhance testosterone, but since additional evidence shows conflicting results, further evidence is needed to confirm this effect.~~~~Fenugreek’s most well-known compound is 4-hydroxyisoleucine, which works to normalize glucose metabolism. The other compounds, called trigonelline, galactomannan, and trigoneosides, also work together to provide benefits for blood sugar.~~~~Supplementing fenugreek may cause body secretions, including urine, to smell like maple syrup. This is due to a metabolite called sotolon.~~~~Fenugreek may enhance libido, but is otherwise non-stimulatory~~~~Has been used historically as a tea, and thus many active constituents may be water soluble. Fenugreek tea does show some insulin sensitizing activity.[1]~~~~Due to the sweet aromatic sotolon, consuming large doses of fenugreek may give off a sweet scent to the urine
Fennel Essential Oil|Fennel Essential oil is seen as a 'stimulatory' essential oil.
Fadogia agrestis|Fadogia agrestis is a nigerian shrubbery that has traditional usage as a proerectile agent. It currently lacks human studies, but appears to have both aphrodisiac and erectile properties in rats. Possible toxicity needs to be investigated more.~~~~Fadogia agrestis is a traditionally used aphrodisiac herb that, due to one study noting increases in testosterone in rodents, is currently being investigated for its potential as a Testosterone Booster. There is not much evidence on this herb at this time, and despite its traditional usage in marketplaces (Mideast and African regions) there are currently no human studies.~~~~In the rodent studies that have been conducted, this herb appears to potently boost testosterone and act as a libido enhancer. It has been noted that while mounting/intromission frequency is increased and latency decreased (common for aphrodisiacs) ejaculation latency, or the time required to ejaculate following intromission, appears to be prolonged; this is not common for aphrodisiacs.~~~~Supplementation of Fadogia agrestis is currently not prudent due to a lack of study replication in rodents and no human evidence, and due to a possible increase in lipid peroxidation associated with damaged cell membranes that needs to be investigated further to see if this is a concern and (if it is) how much of a concern it is.
Evolvulus alsinoides|Evolvulus alsinoides is one of four herbs referred to as Shankhapushpi and is traditionally used in Ayurveda for nootropic and psychotropic effects. It appears to enhance learning in otherwise normal rodents with comparable potency to Piracetam.~~~~Evolvulus alsinoides is one of the four herbs that is given the common name of Shankhapushpi, and appears to be a nootropic agent with comparable potency to Piracetam in otherwise healthy young rats. The mechanisms and exact bioactives underlying these benefits are not currently known, but seem to be localized more in the ethanolic extract and are thought to be alkaloids. There is no human data on this plant at this moment in time.~~~~Beyond the memory enhancing properties evolvulus appears to have general anti-inflammatory, adaptogenic, and neuroprotective properties in the brain following oral ingestion and high doses may confer a sedative property. However, there is insufficient evidence to compare the efficacy of evolvulus against other herbs to see if a role for this herb exists or not. The lack of known bioactive limits research on it.
Evodia rutaecarpa|Used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to increase warmth in the body. It might burn fat, but has not really been looked into it; might also decrease the perception of cold like capsaicin does, which indirectly warms you. A good berry for your oats in the winter.~~~~Evodia rutaecarpa is the plant which bears the berries evodia fructae (Fruits of Evodia), which are eaten in Traditional Chinese Medicine as a warming technique. The plant is also touted to reduce pain and gastrointestinal distress, and be anti-cancer.~~~~It has been investigated as a fat burner, but no significantly promising evidence has been shown at this moment in time. It does appear to make animals feel hotter and quite reliably so, but this is a combination of increased heat expenditure (which is a fat burning effect) and minimizing the perception of cold via TRPV1 agonism, similar to the red pepper extract capsaicin. This combination may make one feel warmer despite not increasing caloric expenditure much.~~~~Two studies have been conducted on animals showing anti-obesity effects, but these appear to not be related to the warmth effect of Evodia fruit and they do not necessarily mean it can be used to burn fat.~~~~Beyond that, it shows promise as an anti-cancer agent through some relatively unique mechanisms and shows limited use as a supplement; taking the active ingredients (evodiamine, rutaecarpine) out of the fruit and into a supplemental capsule drastically reduces oral bioavailability. Isolated supplements may be quite worthless outside of the colon and stomach, with fruit or an ethanolic fruit extract being needed to reach the blood in appreciable amounts
Eurycoma Longifolia Jack|Eurycoma (Tongkat Ali, LongJack) is a pro-fertility agent and aphrodisiac that appears to have a large body of evidence supporting this role and some evidence suggesting it may be an anti-estrogen and pro-erectile agent. Lack of evidence for testosterone boosting.~~~~Eurycoma Longifolia Jack is the herb name for what is more commonly known as Tongkat Ali, Malaysian Ginseng, or Longjack.~~~~The aphrodisiac effects of Eurycoma are quite reliable and appear to span a large variety of animal models, limited evidence in female rats but it appears to affect these to a similar extend as in males. It is difficult to do a comparative analysis between other herbal aphrodisiac to assess potency, but Eurycoma is anecdotally one of the better ones.~~~~In addition to the aphrodisiac effects, Eurycoma can also increase sperm production and may directly act as a proerectile agent. At least one molecule in Eurycoma (9-hydroxycanthin-6-one) is associated with both a delay in ejaculation as well as pro-erectile properties (although the ability of this molecule to act via consuming Eurycoma extract is not known).~~~~Hormonally, Eurycoma appears to have remarkable anti-estrogenic effects in vitro and has a potency similar to Tamoxifen when the active ingredient is injected. Promising, but no human studies exist on it currently or studies assessing oral intake of Eurycoma Extract. On the testosterone side of things, the literature appears to be needlessly promising. No peer-reviewed evidence currently establishes Eurycoma as a testosterone booster in otherwise healthy persons or rats but many studies are quick to cite presentations by an M.I Tambi claiming these boosts in testosterone. None of Dr.Tambi's research presented in conferences appears to be indexed in Medline and the claims expressed cannot be proven.
Euonymus alatus|Euonymus Alatus (Gui Jeon Wu) is a traditional medicine touted to improve blood circulation and flow. It is not well studied in that regard and has no human evidence, but may reduce glucose absorption from the intestines after a meal.~~~~Euonymus Alatus does not appear to have much evidence for it at this time, and mostly it is in the exploratory stages of figuring out what the main bioactives are. It appears to be a very good source of the standard flavonoid compounds, and some of them (Quercetin in particular) have a variety of different conjugates. Additionally, a large variety of lignans exist in the stems and may be bioactive.~~~~Surprisingly, not too many unique molecules have been isolated from this herb; the benefits seem to be due to the common ingredients that are found in many different herbs and foods.~~~~Currently, the only evidence that can be somewhat applied to daily life is the inhibition of α-glucosidase seen in vitro and once replicated in rats. This may lessen the spike in blood glucose in response to a starchy meal, but by no means is Euonymus Alatus remarkably potent or novel in this regard; the active components here seem to be ones that are found in many other plants as well.
Eucommia ulmoides|Eucommia ulmoides is a traditional chinese medicine of which the bark is used for medicinal purposes. Although most evidence is preliminary, it has minor antiinflammatory properties may augment steroid signalling.~~~~Eucommia ulmoides is a Traditional Chinese Medicine that has been recommended for vitality enhancement and longevity. It is a collection of flavonoids (ones that are fairly common in the plant world) as well as both lignans and irioid compounds (both of which are not unique to this plant, but tend to be less common).~~~~There is not a lot of human evidence on this plant at this moment in time except for one study noting reductions in blood pressure, but currently the animal evidence and mechanisms suggest that eucommia ulmoides could have a role in preventing bone loss, inducing fat loss, and reducing elevated blood pressure and triglycerides. At least one study suggests that the plant can augment steroid signalling without inherently being a strong agonist (applies to both androgens and estrogens), but this may apply to caprylic acid in general (which would then suggest that coconut oil is better at this role, due to providing much more caprylic acid).~~~~It is not clear exactly how this plant burns fat or the molecules that mediate this effect, but currently the PPAR system is implicated and acute doses of the supplement have been confirmed to increase heat production in rats. The fat loss (or more acurately, anti-obese) effects of the plant in animal models is surprisingly potent among nutritional supplements.~~~~This plant does have potential as a nutritional supplement as, unlike many other plants, it is active at relatively low oral dosages of 3,000mg or less (plant dry weight).
Eschscholzia californica|California Poppy is an herb that has some bioactive alkaloids which may be nootropic or cognitive enhancing in nature; It is currently in the exploratory stages of research.~~~~California Poppy is a common plant in North and South America that has some traditional usage as a sedative and anxiolytic when made as a tea. Two rat studies have observed sedatory and anxiolytic actions, and one human study showed some promise to this claim but conclusions cannot be drawn since it also used another herb in conjunction with California Poppy.~~~~In the preliminary stages of research, the unique alkaloid profile of California Poppy appears to interact with a variety of receptors in potent ways. The vast majority of these leads have not been further investgiated, and conclusions (especially on Serotonin) cannot be drawn at this point in time.~~~~Currently, California Poppy is too preliminary to support any supplemental usage.
Eriobotrya japonica|Eriobotrya japonica (Common Loquat) is a plant whose fruits are commonly consumed for their taste and other parts (seeds, leaves, flowers) used in traditional chinese medicine for treatment of cough and respiratory distress; it appears to be rich in ursolic acid like triterpenoids.~~~~Eriobotrya japonica is the plant which bears the fruits we refer to as 'Loquat', or specifically the common or wild Loquat. While the fruits themselves are sold as a food product with no medicinal history, the seeds have been added to alcoholic drinks which are thought to promote longevity while the leaves have been ingested on an as-needed basis to treat cough, sputum, and throat inflammation associated with sickness.~~~~The leaves themselves are a good source of triterpenoid molecules, with some unique ones including tormentic acid (and some variants) and euscaphic acid although the majority of these triterpenoids are just ursolic acid and a variety of methoxylated or polyhydroxylated variants. It seems to have a wider variety of triterpenoids rather than a high level of any one triterpenoid, and this class of molecules seems to underlie most of the benefits associated with the leaf extracts. There is not a good idea of what molecules are in the seeds, and it is though that they are also a source of triterpenoids since no unique molecules are known in them.~~~~The benefits of this plant right now tend to be associated with either high or undisclosed doses of the seeds, suggesting that they probably don't apply to oral ingestion of standard doses in humans. The only roles where supplementation may be useful are in control of diabetes and possibly in reducing ulcer formation, but both of these claims can be achieved if not easily outperformed by using isolated ursolic acid or other supplements. There is not enough research into the variety of triterpenoid variations (the polyhydroxylated or methyoxylated variants) to know if they possess unique properties or not.
Ephedrine|Ephedrine is one of the four active components of the herb Ephedra. It is able to induce fat loss via increasing the amount of fat available for fuel as well as by increasing heat expenditure. It has been implicated in increasing the metabolic rate by up to 5% in humans. It has also been noted to cause serious side-effects in some instances, and its legal status varies by region.~~~~While dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids have been used with an acceptable margin of safety and efficacy by many individuals, they can be downright dangerous for those with certain underlying medical conditions. A number of case reports have implicated ephedrine alkaloids as the cause of serious adverse health effects in isolated individuals- including but not limited to heart attack, stroke, seizures, and even death.[9] It should also be noted that supplements ephedrine alkaloids are currently banned in the United States.[10] Any decision to use ephedrine or ephedra products should be made in close consultation with your personal physician.~~Ephedrine (ih-fed-rin) is one of the four active components of the herb Ephedra. It is able to induce fat loss via increasing the amount of fat available for fuel as well as by increasing heat expenditure. It has been implicated in increasing the metabolic rate by up to 5% in humans.~~~~Ephedrine also interacts with muscle cells, increasing heat expenditure in them as well as fat cells. It can also prevent the breakdown of muscle tissue to a small degree.~~~~Ephedrine is highly synergistic with caffeine, and for this reason is commonly found in something called an ECA stack (Ephedrine, Caffeine, and Aspirin).~~~~Side effects include an increase in blood pressure that goes away with cessation and increases in some blood parameters (glucose, insulin) that also go away with cessation of use. It has been reported to be a hyperstimulant when taken in doses above what is recommended.~~~~Ephedrine is well studied and a fairly reliable compound for short- to medium-term weight loss (less than 6 months) and mild performance improvements, usually in trained individuals. However, it does not work under all situations; longer-term weight loss and effects in untrained individuals have not been studied much and sometimes produce negative results. While it has been implicated in weight reduction independent of exercise and diet changes, efficacy is maximized with minimal side-effects when ephedrine is combined with diet and exercise.
Energy Drinks|Energy Drinks are drinks that are touted to give Energy, usually being a drink of caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone and B-complex vitamins with one or two random things thrown in to sound pretty and for marketability. They should be treated like a carbonated sum of the parts.~~~~Energy Drinks are a classification of drinks designed to provide acute neural benefits such as stimulation, focus, and anti-fatigue. Most energy drinks have caffeine as their primary ingredient.~~~~'Energy Drinks' are fairly well studied as a combination of ingredients, and even more so as isolated ingredients. That being said, sometimes the combination of ingredients exerts different effects than isolated ingredients (when beneficial, it is known as 'synergism')
Emblica officinalis|Emblica officinalis (Amla) is an ayurvedic herb which has all parts, including the fruits, used for preventative and therapeutic purposes. It appears to be most used for regulating glucose metabolism and cardiac health, and may also be neuroprotective.~~~~Emblica officinalis (also referred to as Phyllanica emblica or simply as Amla) is a herb from Indian medicine (Ayurveda) that has traditionally been used for the purposes of enhancing general vitality and cognition as well as promoting longevity; a goal similar to adaptogen compounds (although an adaptogenic effect has not clearly been demonstrated with Amla).~~~~There is very limited human evidence on Amla at this moment in time, but it appears to be very promising as it could lower blood glucose in both healthy persons and diabetics with a potency similar to the reference drug glibenclamide. In animal research, amla appears to be able to reduce triglycerides and better the cholesterol profile as well as benefit cardiovascular health (the heart and vessels themselves). Most of these actions are attributed to its antioxidant properties, which are partially derived from a high Vitamin C content but also from a large amount of tannin compounds that are also found in other potent antioxidants like camellia sinsensis (the plant that bears green tea catechins) and dimocarpus longan.~~~~Along the more interesting but preliminary research is a hair growth promoting effect that exceeds that of minoxidil, and a longevity promoting effect in fruit flies that (while not directly compared against other agents) appears to be more effective than other nutraceutical options.~~~~While there is not enough evidence to recommend Amla for any particular purpose, it appears to possess a wide spectrum of potential benefits that require further research and may contribute to general well being and longevity as insinuated in traditional medicine.
Eleutherococcus senticosus|Eleutherococcus senticosus is an adaptogen and herb that may increase work capacity during strenuous aerobic activity. It also has anti-stress and potential immunity-boosting effects.~~~~Eleutherococcus senticosus, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is an herb used in traditional medicine to combat fatigue. It is an adaptogen compound.~~~~Preliminary evidence suggests that Eleutherococcus senticosus can improve physical performance during periods of high intensity exercise. Unfortunately, this effect is not very reliable. The studies that showed the most promise for Eleutherococcus senticosus also had the worst methodology. Though additional research is needed to confirm Eleutherococcus senticosus’s ergogenic effect, it cannot be disproven either.~~~~Preliminary in vitro (outside the body) and animal research suggests Eleutherococcus senticosus supplementation can provide a variety of protective effects for cognition, meaning it can protect the brain from harm. Again, further research is needed to confirm these effects.
Egg (Chicken)|A shelled vessel for protein and fats in the white and yolk, respectively, that carries a surprisingly large amount of nutrients; especially choline and leucine as well as many carotenoids coloring the yolk. Eggs do not inherently increase circulating cholesterol.~~~~Eggs are the vessel for offspring for various species. Chicken eggs in particular are widely used for human nutrition.~~~~The Egg is divided into a yellow-orange nutrient sac known as the 'Yolk' and the proteinaceous albumin known as the 'White'. The Yolk tends to be the source of most dietary fat and is designed to feed the fetus (if it were present), and the whites the source of most dietary protein and are designed to both supply the yolk with nutrition and to protect the yolk either physically or enzymatically.~~~~Some nutrients or non-nutritive components are placed ubiquitously across the egg, while others are isolated to either the yolk or the white.~~~~(Note: Every egg is different since every hen is different, and dietary factors affect composition of the egg[1][2][3][4])~~~~The Yolk contains:~~~~Dietary Fats and lipids,[5] of which the PUFA content may be affected by hen diet[6]~~~~Dietary Cholesterol~~~~Vitamin E, which decreases with time and may be reduced by 50% over 40 days (refrigerated)[6]~~~~Apovitellinin-I, vitellogenin-1,2 and 3, and apolipoprotein B.[7]~~~~Immunoglobulins[8] and Antibodies[9]~~~~May contain different scented and tasting molecules dependent on feed[10]~~~~Binding proteins for Thaimin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin D, Vitamin A, and cobalamin; as well as the respective vitamins.[11]~~~~Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5)[12]~~~~The bioactive peptide YPEP, which has bone-protective properties.[13]~~~~The White contains:[14]~~~~A wide variety of proteins (78 analyzed with high confidence, 148 overall confirmed, 202 possible) that have (mostly) non-nutritive implications.[14]~~~~Ovalbumin, Ovotransferrin, and Ovomucoid (collectively 75% of total protein content)[14]~~~~Anti-microbial lysosomes[15]~~~~Biotin-binding protein Avidin[16]~~~~Riboflavin and Biotin[11]~~~~Additionally, the shell contains:~~~~Dietary Calcium (as Calcium carbonate)[17]~~~~Apovitellenin-I and Vitellogenins (1-3)[18]~~~~Ovocleidin-17 and 116, Ovocalyxin-32 and 36, clusterin and Kunitz-like protease inhibitor[19]~~~~Uronic Acid[20]~~~~Glycosaminoglycans (correlated with shell physical strength)[21]
Eclipta alba|Eclipta Alba (False Daisy) is a herb that has traditional usage as a liver tonic in Ayurveda. It appears to have preliminary evidence to suggest hair growth promotion as potent as Minoxidil and some anti-diabetic effects as well as liver protection.~~~~Eclipta Alba (False Daisy) is a herb that has traditionally been used in Ayurvedic medicine for being a liver tonic (for which it is one of the more effective herbs apparently) and having beneficial effects on diabetes, eye health, and hair growth.~~~~In regards to these claims, it appears to have some anti-diabetic effects in animal studies with the mechanism of action not yet known. Hair regrowth has been noted in repeated studies with the petroleum ether extract mostly, and its potency rivals that of Minoxidil at 2% solution; combination thrapy of Eclipta Alba with two other herbs (Citrullus Colocynthis and Cuscuta Reflexa) has outperformed Minoxidil according to one study.~~~~Eye health does not have any direct studies on it despite its historical claims, although the one human intervention noted that 7.5% of the sample consuming 3g of the leaves daily claimed they had better eyesight; this study was blinded, and constitutes the only evidence for eye health claims. In a way it is promising (3g of the leaves themselves over 60 days improving eye health even when paricipants were unaware this could be an effect of treatment) but it does not constitute sufficient evidence in and of itself.~~~~Beyond the possible eye/hair benefits and the liver protection, other possible benefits of Eclipta Alba are lessened anger (two animal studies, moderate oral doses), pain reduction (dose dependent, which outperfomed Aspirin when consumed at higher doses of 500mg/kg rats; 80mg/kg ethanolic extract in humans) a reduction in blood pressure, diuretic effects, with at least one study suggesting some benefit to the immune system (increasing macrophage and white blood cell activity).~~~~A possibly promising herb for wellness and beauty, but requires more studies on it.
Ecklonia cava|Ecklonia Cava is a brown seaweed with a rich polyphenolic content (this particular subset being known as eckols or phlorotannins) that confers anti-oxidant properties, it is being investigated for health properties.~~~~Ecklonia Cava is a type of seaweed which is known to be one of the highest sources of phloroglucinols, a type of antioxidant compound that appears to be unique to sea plants. The phloroglucinols appear to be very potent anti-oxidants, and these benefits have been noted after oral ingestion as well.~~~~That being said, the potency of Phloroglucinols being anti-oxidants seems to be a bit separate from the magnitude of benefit one gets from ingesting these compounds. Benefits have been noted on blood pressure, blood glucose, and inflammation but for the most part these are statistically sound but practically small benefits. The current human evidence is unconvincing for the most part, although these compounds and seaweed are undoubtedly 'healthy' as a general statement.~~~~Other effects that seem interesting for Ecklonia Cava are an apparently anti-allergic potential that is not highly explored, and there appears to be some anti-cancer properties as well (mostly tested in regards to melanoma). Topical application of Ecklonia is one of a few compounds that can enhance hair growth, and it appears to be novel in the sense that it both inhibits androgen-induced hair loss and also directly enhances hair growth (so it, by itself, appears to be some form of combination therapy).
Echinacea|Echinacea purpurea is a herb commonly used either in response to or daily for prevention of the common cold. It may hold benefit in doing so, although it outperforms placebo unreliably and the amount of benefit derived is similarly unreliable.~~~~Echinacea is a herbal supplement that is commonly used either at the first signs of sickness (in an attempt to accelerate the rate of recovery) or daily as a preventative supplement in persons who are sick frequently (in hopes of reducing the frequency of which they get sick). The term 'echinacea' refers to a genera of plants, and a few species in this family including purpurea and angustifolia are desired due to their alkylamide content (seen as the active ingredients).~~~~Overall, echinacea appears to be somewhat effective for fighting off sickness and accelerating the rate of recovery in sickness but both of these claims are highly variable. There are trials suggesting remarkable recovery rates, and there are trials suggesting no benefits whatsoever. When looking at meta-analyses on the topic, there appears to be a positive and protective effect of echinacea on sickness frequency (in those who are frequently sick) and in accelerating the rate of recovery; the effect size, however, is not large. When looking at the severity of sickness or symptoms of the cold, echinacea does not appear to have any significant influence (unlike something like andrographis paniculata).~~~~The mechanisms are thought to either be due to macrophage stimulation (which although the alkylamides can stimulate macrophages via cannabinoid receptors, contamination of supplements with lipopolysaccharide/LPS appears to be the main stimulatory) or from producing more antigen-specific immunoglobulins.~~~~This variability is likely due to the alkylamide mixture, where the term 'alkylamide' refers to over 20 similarly structured compounds that vary in their ratios to one another from one batch of echinacea to the next (due to growing conditions, usually), although some context-dependent effects of echinacea cannot be ruled out.~~~~Overally, echinacea may be the best option available at this time but by no means is a highly reliable intervention for reducing cold frequency or sickness length.
Ecdysteroids|Ecdysteroids are a class of hormones that are the androgens of insects; they are involved with reproduction and molting, but human ingestion might be healthy or increase muscle mass. Human interventions are lacking and problems with ecdysteroid ingestion exist.~~~~Ecdysteroids are a class of compounds (polyhydroxylated ketosteroids, with various tails) that are structurally similar to androgens. They are well studied as plant and insect growth factors, and derived their name (ecdy-) from the process of molting in insects, called ecdysis.~~~~Ecdysteroid is a category, and popular ecdysteroids include 'ecdysone', 'ecdysterone', 'turkesterone' and '20-hydroxyecdysone'. These four are the most commonly studied, but each ecdysteroid shares the same general properties although varies in potency and effects slightly. Turkesterone appears to be the most anabolic.~~~~They have some biological effects in mammals when orally ingested, and have been called by some researchers as "behaving similar to anabolic steroids putatively without the androgenic effect".[1] Due to the lack of androgenicity, their safety profiles are much greater than anabolic androgenic steroids.~~~~Additionally, they seem to have a wide variety of side-effects that are deemed as healthy. Ecdysteroids can lower cholesterol and blood glucose, are seen as healthy for the liver and intestines by increasing protein synthesis rates, and may have protective effects on neural tissue.~~~~A lack of trails are currently available for humans, but promising evidence is available for in vitro studies on human muscle fibers as well as a multitude of animal models showing enhanced growth rates with ecdysteroid ingestion.~~~~Hypoglycemic effects of edcdysterone and its plant sources seems to be dose-dependent, although a good dose that is used safely is typically 200mg a day.~~~~An oral dose of 5mg/kg bodyweight in rats seems to possess anabolic properties, and would be a good place to start for increasing muscle mass.
ECA|ECA stands for Ephedrine, Caffeine and Aspirin; these compounds were found to be synergistic for fat loss, and isolating ephedrine from the Ephedra Sinicus plant and putting it into ECA appears to be quite an effective method of fat loss and neural stimulation.~~~~The ECA stack is a commonly used fat burning stack consisting of Ephedrine, Caffeine, and Aspirin.~~~~The main component, Ephedrine, is the main active ingredient for weight loss and the caffeine augments its efficacy. The aspirin is added to prevent blood clotting (which may be a side effect of ephedrine) and to aid in the signal transduction of ephedrine via prostaglandin inhibition.~~~~Some proponents of the ECA stack recommend replacing the Aspirin in the stack with either Fish Oil or White willow bark, as Aspirin is linked to various organ side effects and the previous two compounds share the same anti-clotting mechanisms.~~~~Studies have shown that the combination of Ephedrine and Caffeine is superior for fat loss than taking each individually.  As ephedrine can increase heart rate and caffeine may increase blood pressure (in a naive user), the combination tends to have an additive rather than synergistic toxicological profile
Dioscorea villosa|Dioscorea villosa is one of the species of yam referred to as ‘wild yam’. It is claimed to alleviate symptoms of menopause, but there is no evidence to support this effect. Dioscorea villosa is one of the species of yam referred to as ‘wild yam’.~~~~Dioscorea villosa has been claimed to alleviate symptoms of menopause, but there is currently no evidence to support this effect.~~~~Animal evidence suggests Dioscorea villosa can increase skin thickness after low-dose supplementation. This effect suggests Dioscorea villosa is a potentially useful supplement for skin care, but more research is needed before it can be specifically recommended as a cosmetic supplement.~~~~Dioscorea villosa is claimed to alleviate symptoms of menopause because the molecular structures of the yam are similar to many steroid-like compounds. Dioscorea villosa may have effects similar to Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).~~~~Unfortunately, Dioscorea villosa extracts are associated with kidney and liver fibrosis, a condition characterized by excessive scar tissue. Though this effect is weak, it appears to be both time and dose-dependent. For this reason, chronic supplementation of Dioscorea villosa is not recommended.
Dimocarpus longan|Dimocarpus Longan (Dragon Eye or Euphoria) is a fruit with limited medicinal use. It does not appear to have a unique composition, but extracts appear quite neuroprotective and may boost cognition.  Longan fruits (Dragon Eye and Euphoria Longan have both been used to refer to Longan fruits) have some traditional usage for alleviating cognitive losses and improving memory. Limited evidence so far suggests this may be true, as oral administration of the fruits to rats appears to exhibit potent neuroprotective effects and has twice been implicated in enhancing cognition.~~~~However, the composition of Longan fruits currently is not remarkable. It is a great source of ellagic and gallic acids, which are potent anti-oxidants; these compounds are not inherently linked to improvements in cognition nor are the Procyanidins or catechins found in Longan. There actually does not appear to be a large amount of compounds known to be unique to Longan fruits, which may be discovered in the future. No bioactive is linked to the cognitive protective or memory enhancing properties.~~~~Beyond that, the polysaccharides appear to be able to interact with the immune system and can act in an immunostimulatory manner. At least one study suggests that the potency is comparable to Ganoderic Acid (from Reishi) but this needs to be replicated; it is another promising avenue.~~~~Other interactions of Longan such as interactions with fat mass, skin quality, or the colorectal cancer interactions are currently unremarkable. There is not enough evidence to suggest Longan fruit as a recommended option for anything although it might be a useful functional food to ingest for cognitive purposes.
Diindolylmethane|Diindoylmethane is a molecule which is named after its structure, two indole groups attached to a methane group. It is commonly found in broccoli, and holds promise as being a molecule for anti-cancer effects and as an aromatase inhibitor. Diindoylymethane (DIM) is a component of Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) found in members of the Brassica family. Most notably broccoli, kale, and cauliflower.~~~~It has potent effects on estrogen metabolism and is able to keep the body relatively balanced (by preventing either drastic increases or decreases in estrogen). In small amounts, it can both inhibit the aromatase enzyme (and prevent conversion of testosterone into estrogen) and it can act on more potent forms of estrogen and convert them into less potent forms; this conversion reduces the overall effects of estrogen in the body. However, taking too much DIM at once can actually induce the aromatase enzyme and act in the opposite manner and increase estrogen synthesis.~~~~DIM also exerts numerous anti-carcinogenic (anti-cancer) effects in the body and is one of the reasons this vegetable family is seen as healthy.
Dendrobium|Dendrobium is a family of plants (well over 200 commonly used) that has a history of medicinal usage in East Asia. The bioactivities vary depending on species, but it appears many cater towards reducing inflammation and as a digestive aid.
Dehydroepiandrosterone|DHEA is a naturally occurring hormone and either exerts benefits on its own, or can convert into both testosterone or estrogen depending on the body's need. DHEA supplementation is potent for reducing the 'effects of aging', but appears quite unreliable in its benefits.
Dark Therapy|Hiding in the darkness like a vampire, seeking its nightly hit of Melatonin. Dark Therapy is the gradual process of eliminating light sources closer to sleep, and swapping blue or fluorescent light sources for dim red or pink sources; humorous orange tinted sunglasses may be used. Dark therapy is the process of greatly reducing exposure to any light during the hours before sleep. This is done to prevent the breakdown of Melatonin by blue light, which is an important hormone involved in regulating the bodily circadian rhythm.~~~~Dark therapy has been used successfully for the treatment of mania in bipolar depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, and for migraines and headaches.~~~~The upregulation of melatonin associated with dark therapy is associated with a variety of improvements as well. This includes decreased risk of headaches, cancer, and obesity. Some of the anti-obesity effects may be mediated by melatonin's effects on thyroid function.~~~~A novel approach of simulating total darkness is blocking out light in the blue wavelengths, which are responsible for the breakdown of the hormone melatonin. Amber colored glasses have been used to stimulate dark therapy with efficacy.
Damiana Leaf|Damiana Leaf is a part of the Tunera Diffusa plant which is traditionally used as an aphrodisiac and physical tonic. Not much evidence on this plant, but may be slightly effective in rat models of aphrodisia when coupled with fatigue. Damiana Leaf is a supplement consisting of the dried leaves of the Turnera Diffusa plant, which has traditionally been brewed as a tea for use as a physical tonic and aphrodisiac in Central America (with some references to the Mayan culture, but more recently Mexico).~~~~Evidence on Damiana Leaf is lacklustre. Not too many studies have been conducted on it, and most are studies attempting to isolate bioactive ingredients from the compound. Two studies have been conducted in rats showing aphrodisiac properties when the rats are either sexually sluggish or fatigued, which is an effective that can possibly be mimicked by any adaptogen class supplement and more of a credit to the 'physical tonic' aspect of Damiana than the aphrodisiac properties.~~~~There is some limited evidence that it may reduce anxiety, but due to Damiana being a fairly good source of Apigenin these effects can probably extend to any Apigenin-containing plant, of which there are several (not limited to chamomile tea and lemon balm).~~~~Beyond that, there is not much quality evidence to support usage of Damiana as aphrodisiac. All human studies using Damiana are currently confounded with usage of multiple bioactive components which complicates assessment of Damiana itself.
Dactylorhiza hatagirea|Dactylorhiza hatagirea is an ayurvedic sexual stimulant. There is very limited evidence on this reported tonic, and preliminary studies into its activities have confirmed a libido enhancing and possible testosterone boosting effect in rats. Dactylorhiza hatagirea is a herb from ayurvedic medicine mostly touted to increase male fertility and virility. It has little to no evidence for it, with the two studies assessing these traditional claims noting that they appear to be correct yet they have failed to outperform other ayurvedic herbs (that have more studies on them).
DMAE|DMAE is a choline molecule with one less methyl group, and has the ability to reduce build-up of the age pigmentation known as beta-amyloid. It is the active component of Centrophenoxine, or Lucidril, a pharmaceutical designed for cognitive health in the elderly. DMAE is a compound that is known as a mind health compound. It does this by reducing buildup of what is known as the 'age pigment', which impairs cognitive function and is implicated in the cognitive decline with age. It can also increase levels of the compound involved with memory, acetylcholine.~~~~It can also protect neurons and other cells from harmful effects of certain types of oxidation by embedding itself in the structure of the cell and acting as an anti-oxidant, as well as sustaining metabolic processes in the body through a process known as 'methyl donation'.~~~~DMAE is also found in various face and body creams, and can tighten and tone skin quality.
D-Serine|D-Serine is an amino acid that plays a role in cognitive enhancement and schizophrenia treatment. D-Serine is an amino acid found in the brain. Derived from glycine, d-serine is a neuromodulator, meaning it regulates the activities of neurons.~~~~D-Serine supplementation can reduce symptoms of cognitive decline. It is also able to reduce symptoms of diseases characterized by reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) signaling, which includes cocaine dependence and schizophrenia.~~~~D-Serine’s effect on schizophrenia is well researched, and though it shows promise, it is also unreliable, since d-serine does not always reach the blood after supplementation. Sarcosine may be a more reliable treatment.~~~~D-Serine is a coagonist at NDMA receptors, which means it improves the effects of other compounds that bind with the receptor. These compounds include glutamate and NMDA itself.~~~~D-Serine is often categorized as a nootropic.
D-Ribose|D-ribose is a pentose sugar that plays a role in the production of energy intermediates, DNA, and RNA. It is due to this reasoning that D-ribose is investigated in instances where ATP concentrations (relative to total nucleotides) seem to be reduced, namely cardiac insults and prolonged physical exercise.
D-Aspartic Acid|D-aspartic acid (D-AA) is an amino acid regulator of testosterone synthesis and may act on a stimulatory receptor (NMDA). D-AA shows promise in aiding male fertility. Healthy men supplementing D-AA experience only temporary increases in testosterone, which limits its use.~~D-aspartic acid is one of two forms of the amino acid aspartic acid. The other form is L-aspartate.~~~~The benefits of D-AA are specific to it, and do not extend to aspartic acid or L-aspartate.~~~~D-AA can be used as a testosterone booster for infertile men, and by athletes as a temporary booster. Elevated testosterone levels only last a week to a week and a half in healthy men, with testosterone returning to normal afterward.~~~~D-AA works in the central brain region to cause a release of hormones, such as luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and growth hormone. It may also build up in the testicles, where it alleviates a rate-limiting step of testosterone synthesis, which leads to a minor testosterone increase.~~~~Further research is needed on D-AA, as most studies attempt to assess D-AA’s role in the body under normal conditions, and not in the frame of supplementation.
Cyanidin|Cyanidin is one of the six Anthocyanin subsets, and its glucoside Cyanidin-3-Glucoside (C3G) has been garnering attention for its ability to decrease blood glucose levels, and its ability to not hinder muscle protein synthesis at the same time (downstream of AMPK activation).~~~~Cyanidins are a sub-category of the dark pigments found in blue-black fruits and berries as well as some purple vegetables known as Anthocyanins. Cyanidins can be seen as the most pharmaceutically effective anthocyanin subcomponent as they seem to have the greatest uptake rate, the least decay, and the most clinical significance out of all anthocyanins.~~~~It has various effects in cells, most of which can be described as being anti-diabetic and possibly slightly benefit other parameters associated with 'metabolic syndrome' (anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, etc.)~~~~It does have some problems with absorption though, so the results you see in in vitro (in laboratory) studies may not apply to when it is consumed. Its bioavailability (percent absorbed) is a concern, and human intervention studies important for this reason.
Curcumin|Curcumin, the primary bioactive substance in turmeric, and has anti-inflammatory properties. Its poor bioavailability can be enhanced in several ways, such as the coingestion of piperine (a component of black pepper).~~~~What is Curcumin?~~Curcumin is a yellow pigment found primarily in turmeric, a flowering plant of the ginger family best known as a spice used in curry. It’s a polyphenol with anti-inflammatory properties and the ability to increase the amount of antioxidants that the body produces.~~~~Curcumin and the curcuminoids found in turmeric can be extracted to produce supplements that have a much higher potency than turmeric. However, curcumin is absorbed poorly during digestion, so a myriad of different formulations have been created to improve its bioavailability.~~~~~~What are Curcumin’s benefits?~~Supplementation of curcumin reliably reduces markers of inflammation and increases the levels of endogenous antioxidants in the body. More research is needed for many areas of health, but what research there is supports a small to moderate improvement in the symptoms of depression and anxiety, and pain and function in osteoarthritis. A reduction in LDL-cholesterol, blood glucose and blood pressure is possible, but the research is less consistent and more is needed.~~~~~~What are Curcumin’s side effects and drawbacks?~~Doses of up to 8 grams of curcuminoids aren’t associated with serious adverse effects in humans. However, long-term studies that are more comprehensive in their assessments are needed. High doses of curcumin may produce nausea and gastrointestinal complaints. Use of curcumin with piperine may cause adverse drug reactions.~~~~~~What is the difference between turmeric and curcumin?~~Turmeric is a popular root/spice, and curcumin is a highly potent chemical in turmeric, but hardly the only one. Curcumin and the curcuminoids are present in turmeric at around 22.21-40.36mg/g in the rhizomes and 1.94mg/g in the tuberous roots, so turmeric is less potent as a source of turmeric than an extract and anti-inflammatory. However, some studies suggest that turmeric has benefits, and it's possible that it has benefits that curcumin alone doesn't, but more research on this is needed.
Cucurbita pepo|Cucurbita pepo is a plant which has variants called pumpkin, squash, zucchini, and gourds; it is sometimes called pumpkin extract (either a water extract or seed oil) and appears to be a phytopharmaceutical for prostate disorders.
Creatinol O-Phosphate|Creatinol O-Phosphate (COP) is a creatine analogue synthesized for the treatment of heart complications. It appears to protect cardiac cells at 3g injections, but does not have sufficient evidence for oral consumption.~~~~Creatinol O-Phosphate (COP) is a synthetic analogue of creatine that was created as a cardioprotective drug, and it appears to be helpful against arrythmia and aid the integrity of cardiac tissue following injections of up to three grams. Via this method of administration and dosage, it appears to be safe as well as effective.~~~~A lack of information exists on COP oral ingestion and whether the benefits translate from oral to injections. Additionally, all research appears to be a few decades old and has since just ceased for unknown reasons; a weird thing for such a promising compound (unless another cardioprotective agent was deemed safer and more effective, making injections of COP for clinical usage not needed to be researched anymore).~~~~Due to the lack of pharmacokinetic data, it is hard to ascertain the benefits associated with COP ingestion. If absorbed, it will be cardioprotective and safe. Optimal dosing regimen is not known at this time due to no bioavailability data.~~~~For all intents and purposes, COP supplementation should be viewed as completely different as creatine supplementation. Even after COP loses the phosphorus group, it metabolizes into creatinol and not creatine.
Creatine|Creatine is among the most well-researched and effective supplements. It can help with exercise performance by rapidly producing energy during intense activity. Creatine may also provide cognitive benefits but more research is needed in that area.~~~~What is creatine?~~Creatine is a molecule that's produced in the body from amino acids. It's primarily made in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidneys and pancreas. It stores high-energy phosphate groups in the form of phosphocreatine which are donated to ADP, regenerating it to ATP, the primary energy carrier in the body. This role in energy production is particularly relevant under conditions of high energy demand such as intense physical or mental activity.~~~~Creatine can be found in some foods and is most prevalent in meat and fish. Athletes commonly take it as a powder or in capsules.~~~~~~What are creatine’s benefits?~~The primary benefit of creatine is an improvement in strength and power output during resistance exercise. For this purpose, creatine is well-researched, and the effects are quite notable for a supplement. When used in conjunction with resistance exercise, creatine may modestly increase lean mass. It has also been tested for anaerobic running capacity in many studies, the results of which are fairly mixed but generally suggest a small improvement in performance.~~~~While creatine has been research far less for cognitive performance than physical performance, it may have benefits in some contexts. A reduction in mental fatigue has been observed in various scenarios such as demanding mental activity, sleep deprivation, and traumatic brain injury. Creatine may improve working memory, though likely only for those with below average creatine levels such as vegetarians and the elderly. We need more research in these areas and other cognitive measures before creatine can be said to be effective.~~~~~~What are creatine’s side effects and drawbacks?~~When taken without sufficient water, stomach cramping can occur. Diarrhea and nausea can occur when too much creatine is taken at once, in which case doses should be spread out throughout the day and taken with meals.~~~~~~Is creatine safe?~~Most of the supposed dangers of creatine are unfounded. Due to the bad reputation of performance-enhancing drugs, it has been wrongfully equated with the worst examples. It also increases levels of creatinine in the body, which are a marker of poor kidney function. However, the increase in creatinine isn't due to kidney damage, but simply more creatinine being produced. There is a lack of long-term studies in people with reduced kidney function, however, so caution could still be taken in that instance. Besides the minor gastrointestinal issues from excessive creatine, it is unlikely to be unsafe or bad for you.
Crataegus pinnatifida|Crataegus pinnatifida, also known as Chinese hawthorn, is a berry that is being investigated for its anti-inflammatory and anti-allergy effects.~~~~Crataegus pinnatifida, also known as Chinese hawthorn, is a berry traditionally used to improve heart health.~~~~Crataegus pinnatifida is sometimes recommended as a supplement to control lipid levels. Crataegus pinnatifida may be able to block lipid absorption in the intestines, but this effect is unreliable and needs further study.~~~~Crataegus pinnatifida has a more powerful effect on restricting lipid absorption than orlistat, an anti-obesity drug. An ethanolic extract of Crataegus pinnatifida leaves was found to have a stronger anti-allergic effect than Montelukast, a brand name drug for asthma and allergy relief.~~~~There have been no human studies done on Crataegus pinnatifida, and the two main effects of the plant, reduced lipid absorption and allergy relief, have not been linked to any bioactive compounds in the plant.~~~~Though preliminary evidence suggests the fruit and leaves of Crataegus pinnatifida are a promising heart supplement, there is not enough evidence for its effects to specifically recommend the plant for supplementation.
Cordyceps|Cordyceps is a mushroom used in Traditional Chinese Medicine that is touted to be anti-aging and pro-vitality; these quite vague claims have not yet been looked at in human interventions. It can regulate testicular testosterone production, but has complex mechanisms.
Copper|Copper is an essential mineral for antioxidative enzymes in the human body. While vital, it appears to be sufficient in the human diet and water supply with little evidence concerning its usefulness as a supplement. Excess copper is involved in some cases of Alzheimer's.~~~~Copper is an essential trace mineral that is used in a variety of processes in the body. The major function for copper is in catalyzing oxidation-reduction (REDOX) reactions important for the activity of a number of enzymes. Although copper is essential to health, most Western diets meet the recommended intake, making supplementation unnecessary in most healthy individuals.~~~~Cases where copper deficiency may occur include patients who have undergone gastric bypass as well as chronic users of proton pump inhibitors, both of which interfere with copper absorption. Also, high levels of zinc intake may increase production of a protein known as metallothionein that can bind copper and reduce its levels in the body.~~~~Although the REDOX chemistry catalyzed by copper is essential for a number of immune functions, copper also may play a role in Alzheimer's disease. Copper levels generally rise in the body with age, but seem to rise more sharply in those with Alzheimer's. Moreover, copper levels have been linked to Alzheimer's symptom severity, leading some to suggest that a lower copper intake may benefit the elderly.
Convolvulus pluricaulis|Convolvulus pluricaulis is one of four herbs referred to as Shankhapushpi in Ayurveda, and is traditionally used for its cognitive promiting and nootropic effects. It appears to have efficacy in animals.~~~~Convolvulus pluricaulis is one of four herbs with the common name of Shankhapushpi that has traditionally been used as a cognitive enhancing herb and nootropic. Although there is not a large amount of evidence in support of convolvulus, it appears to be able to promote learning in otherwise healthy rats and mice with a potency similar to the reference drug Piracetam and the other Shankhapushpi herb known as Evolvulus alsinoides. The mechanisms underlying the enhancement of learning are not currently known.~~~~Other neural effects of convolvulus include sedative properties (seem to be relevant at doses higher than used for learning enhancement), anxiolytic and anti-depressive properties, and possible neuroprotective properties; currently there is insufficient evidence to examine how relevant convolvulus is for these goals and the limited evidence is somewhat contradictory (depression) or otherwise does not suggest remarkable potency.
Conjugated Linoleic Acid|CLA are fatty acids that acts on a system known as PPAR to induce fat loss. At least, that is what the theory says. CLA too weakly affects PPAR receptors to really induce fat loss in an appreciable amount. TTA appears more promising.~~~~Conjugated Linoleic Acid, or CLA, is a term used to refer to a mixture of fatty acids that have the general structure of linoleic acid (18 carbons in length, 2 double bonds) where the double bonds exist two carbons away from each other; they are all polyunsaturated fatty acids, and some may be trans fatty acids.~~~~Although many exist, only two are commonly referred to. One called c9t11 (cis-9, trans-11) and the other t10c12 (trans-10, cis-12), named after what bond occurs where on the side chain.~~~~CLA has been investigated to be a fat burner and health promoting agent due to its effect on a molecular signalling receptor family named PPAR which is related to fat burning, steroid signalling, inflammation, and glucose/lipid metabolism.~~~~However, human studies on CLA are very unreliable and the overall effects seen with CLA are not overly potent as well as sometimes contradicting. CLA is a good research standard to investigated fatty acids and the PPAR system, but its usage as a supplement for personal goals is quite lacklustre.
Coluracetam|Coluracetam (MKC-231) is a racetam drug purported to be a cognitive enhancing drug. It is able to preserve choline uptake into neurons when they are otherwise impaired, but currently there is no evidence for inherent nootropic effects.~~~~Coluracetam (MKC-231) is a synthetic racetam drug purported to be a nootropic compound. It does not have a large body of evidence investigating it, but the mechanisms of action (as well as structute) appear to be very distinct from other racetam compounds like Piracetam or Aniracetam.~~~~Coluracetam appears to interact with a process known as high affinity choline uptake (HACU for short), which is the rate-limiting step of drawing choline into a neuron for synthesis into the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Increasing the HACU rate appears to increase the activity of cholinergic neurons, so it is a desired target for cognitive enhancement.~~~~Interventions in rats (as there is no human evidence currently) support the usage of coluracetam at very low oral doses to preserve HACU that is otherwise impaired by the use of research drugs that are known to impair HACU. The limited evidence looking at the inherent effects of coluracetam on the HACU of normal neurons has failed to find any significant interaction.~~~~Coluracetam has also been noted to associate with choline transporters physically, but it is not known exactly what it does once associated.~~~~Overall, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the usage of coluracetam for cognitive enhancement. Further studies are needed to see if it has a therapeutic role in instances where HACU may be impaired (such as Alzheimer's disease).
Colostrum|Colostrum, also known as first milk, is a mammary secretion produced by cows and related animals. The results of supplementation are similar to supplementing whey protein, though colostrum may offer some unique benefits for the immune and digestive systems.~~~~Colostrum is a pre-milk fluid produced in the mammary glands of mammals that have recently given birth. Newborns have immature digestive and immune systems, so the enzymes, antibodies, and growth factors colostrum provides promote growth and fight disease. Though colostrum is produced by all mammals, colostrum supplements are usually derived from bovine or (less frequently) goat sources. Colostrum has become a popular nutritional supplement because it is a rich source of enzymes, antibodies, and growth factors not found in other dairy products.~~~~The undeveloped intestinal tract of a newborn allows the growth factors present in colostrum to pass freely through the intestinal wall for absorption. However, fully-developed adult mammal intestines will break down the beneficial compounds before they can be absorbed into the blood stream. Though digestive enzymes prevent colostrum growth factors from affecting muscles, they will still exert a local effect, which increase intestinal integrity. This prevents inflammation, like the kind that can be caused by prolonged, intense exercise, like competitive cycling. Outside of intense exercise, supplementing colostrum will have an effect similar to supplementing whey protein or casein protein.~~~~Athletes often supplement colostrum in an effort to increase fat burning, add lean mass, or increase strength. Since their digestive systems are fully developed, these effects do not occur, and the body breaks down the growth factors and enzymes that colostrum provides before they can be transported to muscle cells.~~~~The antibodies present in colostrum are also effective at reducing diarrhea caused by Escherichia coli and reducing the risk of HIV infection. To prevent E. coli-induced diarrhea, the colostrum must be obtained from an immunized animal.
Coleus forskohlii|Coleus forskohlii is an herb used in traditional medicine that may boost testosterone and induce fat loss, particularly in men.~~~~Coleus forskohlii is an herb historically used in Ayurveda (Ayurvedic medicine).~~~~Today, Coleus forskohlii is used as a fat burning supplement.~~~~The main bioactive ingredient in Coleus forskohlii is called forskolin. Through forskolin, Coleus forskohlii supplementation may increase testosterone, and protect against cancer and inflammation. Further research is needed to confirm these effects, since forskolin is most often used as a research tool in vitro, or outside the body, like in a test tube or petri dish. Forskolin may act differently inside the body.~~~~Forskolin increases cellular levels of a molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Elevated cAMP levels are associated with increased rates of fat loss, and can improve the effects of other fat burning compounds.~~~~Forskolin is still being researched for its effects on testosterone and fat loss, but preliminary evidence is promising.
Cold Exposure|The act of exposing yourself to the cold and feeling the cold and, gritting your teeth through the discomfort. It actually does appear to burn fat in an attempt to warm the body, and may carry some health benefits.~~~~Cold exposure is a technique in which a person voluntarily expose themselves to temperatures below their comfort level. This voluntary deviation from the body's ideal temperature causes reactions in the body to maintain the internal temperature; some of these reactions are increased metabolic rate to produce heat, which results in weight loss.~~~~The benefits seen are long term (adaptive), and thus not likely to occur with one or two isolated ventures. They are directly proportional (to a degree) to the variance between comfort level temperature and the temperature one partakes in.
Coffee|Sometimes referred to as liquid gold, coffee is the most popular source of caffeine in North America (and behind only teas worldwide). Also a source of tons of nutrients, and most recently touted as a source of chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid.~~~~Coffee, black gold, 'poison of choice'. Whatever you call it, it is the world's second most popular non-water beverage (second only to all forms of tea combined) and consumed world-wide.~~~~Coffee can be seen as a nutritional product as it is a mixture of many nutriceutical compounds that all have individual purposes. Coffee can also exert effects like any supplement or drug and rival some of them in potency. It is not just an inert food product, coffee is a supplement.
Coenzyme Q10|Coenzyme Q10 is a molecule found in mitochondria that has a critical role in producing energy for the body. It also plays an important role in the endogenous antioxidant system.  What is Coenzyme Q10?~~Coenzyme Q10 (COQ10) is a molecule produced in the body. It aids mitochondria during energy production and is a part of the endogenous antioxidant system. It is similar to other pseudovitamin compounds because it is vital for survival, but does not necessarily need to be taken as a supplement. However, there is a potential for deficiency due to suffering a heart attack, taking statins, various disease states, and aging.~~~~It is found in various foods; mainly meat and fish.~~~~~~What are Coenzyme Q10’s benefits?~~Some research suggests minor improvements in the function of blood vessels, leading to reduce blood pressure and improved blood flow. However, more studies are needed to confirm this. The proposed mechanism is related to nitric oxide preservation, as seen with grape seed extract, pycnogenol, and resveratrol.~~~~It seems to be strongly effective for reducing the symptoms of fibromyalgia, but this is based on a handful of small studies, and much more research is needed to confirm this.~~~~~~What are Coenzyme Q10’s side effects and drawbacks?~~It seems to be safe but more research is needed to evaluate its safety in the long-term. In animals, a massive dose of 350mg/kg body weight has been observed to exacerbate the effects of aging, but human studies don't suggest any convincing adverse effects from normal doses.
Codonopsis pilosula|Codonopsis Pilosula (Dangshen) is a herb that has historically been used as a cheap replacement for Panax Ginseng which was costly. Dangshen may have cognitive boosting capacities on its own, but is quite understudied.
Coconut Oil|Coconut oil is a highly saturated oil derived from coconuts, made up primarily of lauric acid and other medium-chain triglycerides, which are responsible for many of its metabolic effects. It is also a popular cosmetic.~~~~Coconut oil is an oil product derived from Cocos nucifera, commonly known as the coconut.~~~~Coconut oil is used frequently in cosmetics as a topically-applied moisturizer. The effects of coconut oil on skin and hair after ingestion have not been studied.~~~~The majority of coconut oil (65%) is made up of medium-chain triglycerides(MCTs), which are triglycerides and fatty acids with a carbon length chain of 6 – 12. Studies suggest replacing calories with MCTs without exceeding daily caloric requirements can result in a small, but significant, increase in the rate of fat loss over time. This effect appears to be slightly more powerful in overweight people.~~~~Coconut oil may also temporarily increase metabolic rate and the speed at which fats are broken down to release fatty acids, a process known as lipolysis. This effect occurs when coconut oil is first added to the diet and disappears after two weeks. Coconut oil also creates more ketone bodies than longer chain fatty acids when it is broken down. One study has provided evidence that this mechanism is what causes coconut oil to provide obese people with a muscle preserving effect during caloric restriction. This effect has not been replicated in lean people.~~~~Adding coconut oil to a diet is unlikely to cause noticeable fat loss effects, but it can replace other dietary fatty acids in order to fine-tune a diet plan.
Cocoa Extract|Cocoa extract is a bitter mixture with a chocolate taste, made up of xanthine molecules (theobromine and caffeine) and procyanidins. Supplementing cocoa extract may provide cardiovascular and cognitive benefits through improved blood flow and antioxidant effects.~~Cocoa extract refers to the bioactive compounds found in cocoa products. These compounds include flavanols, procyanidins and (-)-epicatechin. Though these molecules are not unique to cocoa, cocoa extract contains a particularly high level of (-)-epicatechin, compared to other plant products.~~~~Supplementing cocoa extract or eating dark chocolate is linked to better blood flow and improved insulin sensitivity.~~~~Preliminary research suggests (-)-epicatechin may also provide benefits for longevity by increasing blood flow and oxygenation in the brain. Though this effect has not been linked to improved memory or cognitive performance, it may play a protective role during aging. Some evidence also suggests (-)-epicatechin can help mitigate the effects of impaired mitochondria.~~~~When (-)-epicatechin is absorbed by the body, it activates an insulin signaling pathway, which causes a mild increase in glucose uptake. Increased glucose uptake means the body is able to take in sugar from the blood more effectively. Supplementing (-)-epicatechin also increase the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that widens blood vessels and improves blood flow.~~~~Eating about 26-40g of dark chocolate products containing at least 75% cocoa makes supplementing cocoa extract and (-)-epicatechin unnecessary. This is about 200 calories of dark chocolate, a bit less than a standard candy bar. Products low in cocoa, like milk chocolate and white chocolate, do not replace supplementation. Cocoa extract is a safe supplement that promotes circulation and effective energy production. It has great potential long-term benefits, whether the (-)-epicatechin comes from supplements or food products.
Cnidium monnieri|A pro-erectile herb from traditional chinese medicine, Cnidium monnieri and its main bioactive known as osthole appear to have mechanisms similar to Viagra in penile tissue and the hippocampus; the influence of cnidium monnieri on testosterone and cognition remains unexplored.
Clubmoss|Clubmoss (common word to refer to the Lycopodium/Huperzeria genera of plants) is a collection of plants with traditional usage in promoting memory formation, and appears to have a large collection of unique alkaloids. Its main bioactive is Huperzine-A.
Clitoria ternatea|A subtle brain boosting herb from Ayurveda known as Shanka Pushpi that has mechanisms and traditional usage similar to Bacopa Monnieri but, unlike Bacopa, does not currently have any human interventions to test its efficacy.~~~~Clitoria Ternatea is one of four herbs traditionally used as Shanka Pushpi, an Ayurvedic medicine used to promote neurological health. It shows promise in animal models for its memory enhancing effects, and has a wide spectrum of neurological benefits (anti-depression, anxiolytic, anti-pyretic) yet for these latter claims preliminary evidence suggests it isn't overly potent.~~~~Some other preliminary evidence suggests that it might be healthy for the liver and circulating lipoproteins, as well as a possible benefit diabetics by inhibiting glucose uptake from the diet. However, these claims are much too early to guess their practical relevance on.~~~~Toxicological studies on rodents and historical usage (partially confounded with the three other herbs) suggest that Clitoria Ternatea is safe, but limited evidence exists currently.
Clenbuterol|Clenbuterol is an illegal beta-adrengic agonist used to beef up livestock (before a metabolite was found to be toxic). It is like ephedrine, except much more potent and stays in your body for a day rather than just 4 hours. It is a potent fat loss and muscle preservation agent with side effects.~~~~Clenbuterol is a potent fat-burning compound with significant muscle preserving and building effects.~~~~It was once used in feed animals to increase growth rates of lean mass. It is currently banned for over-the-counter sales and is typically seen as one of the compounds known as 'steroids' (the vague social term for it, as it is not a steroid structure) Despite the ban, it is still used amongst bodybuilding enthusiasts due to its potency.
Citrullus colocynthis|Citrullus colocynthis, also known as bitter cucumber, is a fruit-bearing plant. Low doses of its seeds and fruit can reduce blood glucose levels. Higher doses are associated with side-effects like colonic inflammation and rectal bleeding.~~~~Citrullus colocynthis, also known as bitter cucumber, is a fruit-bearing plant sometimes used medicinally.~~~~Citrullus colocynthis is used to treat diabetes, since it may be able to induce insulin secretion from the pancreas after supplementation, while reducing blood glucose and improving lipid levels.~~~~Preliminary evidence suggests a topical application of Citrullus colocynthis may stimulate hair growth, with an effect comparable to finasteride, a male pattern baldness drug. More evidence is needed to confirm this effect.~~~~Even low doses (100mg, taken three times) of Citrullus colocynthis can cause diarrhea, while higher doses (1,500 mg) can cause colonic inflammation and rectal bleeding. These side-effects stop once supplementation is ceased.~~~~Since the bioactive compounds in Citrullus colocynthis are still unknown, and even low-dose supplementation is associated with intestinal side-effects, Citrullus colocynthis is not recommended for oral supplementation.
Citrulline|L-Citrulline is an amino acid. It is turned into L-arginine in the kidneys after supplementation, which means L-citrulline supplementation is a more effective method of increasing L-arginine levels in the body than L-arginine supplementation.~~What is Citrulline?~~L-Citrulline is one of the three dietary amino acids in the urea cycle, alongside L-arginine and L-Ornithine. Taking L-Citrulline increases plasma levels of ornithine and arginine and improves the ammonia recycling process and nitric oxide metabolism. Consequently, it is used in areas where nitric oxide is relevant, namely erectile dysfunction caused by high blood pressure, athletic performance, and cardiovascular health. There are very few foods that have notable amounts of citrulline.~~~~~~What are Citrulline's benefits?~~Limited research suggests that it results in reduced fatigue and improved endurance for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. There isn't enough evidence to support the claim that L-citrulline supplementation improves power output during exercise. More research for erectile dysfunction and blood pressure is needed, but a small amount of research is supportive of a beneficial effect.~~~~~~What are Citrulline's side effects and drawbacks?~~It's not known to have notable side-effects, though more research is needed to confirm its long-term safety when taken in high doses. Unlike L-arginine and L-ornithine, very high doses don't seem to result in gastrointestinal upset.~~~~~~Is arginine or citrulline better?~~A small amount of research suggests that taking citrulline will lead to higher and more consistent arginine levels than taking arginine. Cirulline is very readily converted to arginine as needed, and it is also better absorbed than arginine, which not only makes it a better source of arginine for the body but can mean a lower rate of gastrointestinal upset than arginine when taken in high doses.~~~~~~What is citrulline malate?~~Citrulline bound to malate, an organic salt of malic acid, an intermediate in the citric acid cycle. It is the most researched form of citrulline, and there is speculation about an independent role of malate in producing performance benefits, but there's insufficient research to compare citrulline malate to L-citrulline directly. Citrulline malate can be taken in the dose used in studies, but it's important to keep in mind that 1.76 g of citrulline malate is needed to about 1 g of citrulline.
Citric Acid|Citric Acid is an intermediate in the Krebs Cycle, and technically crucial for cellular functioning and energy production. Its usage in supplements includes useful things like being bound to minerals (such as Calcium Citrate or Magnesium Citrate) to increase water solubility.~~~~Citric acid is a compound that, in the body, is created for production of cellular energy via the TCA cycle. Supplementation with it has not been shown to increase energy levels as enough is made by the body.~~~~It has an alkalinizing effect on the body when ingested and has been shown in a limited amount of studies to exert some protection against calcium loss in post-menopausal osteroporetic women.
Cissus quadrangularis|Cissus quadrangularis is a traditional medicine for joint and bone health (as well as various feminine disorders and menopause), and shows promise in promoting bone growth rates. It is popular as a joint aid for athletes, with preliminary evidence supporting this property of cissus.~~~~Cissus quadrangularis is a traditional medicine usually said to come from Ayurveda but appears to have a wide range of locations which have used it medicinally due to it growing in numerous locations. Its traditional usages are mostly catered around treating feminine disorders (menopause, libido, and menstrual disorders) or treating bones (increasing bone mass or accelerating fracture healing rates) which gives it the traditional name of the 'Bone Setter'; some other traditional usages are in regards to its supposed antiulcer properties, antihemhorroid properties, and pain relieving properties.~~~~It is most frequently used by athletes, and the anecdotes of cissus seem to precede much of the science on the topic. It appears to be a very effective pain killer in rodent studies, but at this moment in time only one preliminary study has been conducted in humans; while it showed promise in athletes who experienced joint pain due to exercise (by reducing overall joint symptoms by about a third) it was still a lone study. More research is needed, but it seems promising as an alterative for joint pain in athletes since most joint health supplements do not have evidence in athletes (rather, most research is in osteoarthritis persons).~~~~Although a potential complication in athletes is that preliminary rodent evidence suggests that cissus has sedative and muscle relaxing properties at high doses (active within 30 minutes of ingestion), suggesting that it might not make the best pre-workout supplement.~~~~In regards to bone health, there are limited human reports of increased fracture healing rate which are poor quality of evidence due to not disclosing adequate methodlogy (ie. how they did the study) and not disclosing the source of the compound. Animal studies do show a great deal of promise in promoting bone growth, but this traditional claim also needs to be assessed in greater detail.~~~~Finally, there are two human studies which suggest that cissus can be used as a fat loss agent but they have problems with their structure. In particular both studies are confounded with possible financial biases and since the supplements were consumed before meals with water (and cissus is known to have gum forming properties) while food intake was not measured making it wholly possible the observed effects could be due to reduced food intake, which is what happens when a gum (glucomannan, for example) is taken before a meal with water.~~~~Overall, cissus has a good deal of promise in regards to joint and bone health in regards to athletic adults and menopausal women alike but requires a great deal more evidence to fully evaulate this promise.
Cinnamon|Cinnamon is a blend of nutrients commonly used a spice. It can help regulate glucose metabolism in diabetic people, but may also possess some toxic components.~~Cinnamon is popular spice worldwide. It exerts numerous biological effects on the body.~~~~Cinnamon is frequently treated as an anti-diabetic compound, since it reduces the rate at which glucose enters the body. Not only does it help diabetics avoid blood sugar spikes, but it also improves glucose use in the cell itself.~~~~Over time, cinnamon can reduce fasting blood glucose, and potentially cholesterol levels as well.~~~~Cinnamon does not need to be purchased specifically as a supplement, and can be found in grocery stores. It does contain a liver toxin called coumarin, which can be harmful in high doses. Making cinnamon tea can reduce the risk of coumarin poisoning, since the toxin is left behind in the leftover sediment. Ceylon cinnamon, which is dervied from a different plant species, has lower levels of coumarin, which makes it a better supplement option.
Chrysin|A flavonoid compound found in bee pollen and propolis. Can boost testosterone when injected into testicles; otherwise isn't absorbed at all. Unless better absorption arises, chrysin remains a pretty interesting colon cancer preventative agent that does not boost testosterone.~~~~Chrysin is a bioflavonoid compound found in high levels in propolis and in honey.~~~~Chrysin is most well known for being a testosterone boosting plant compound, although this seems to be a misleading claim. While it has very good mechanisms of action that would lead to the conclusion that it could boost testosterone (as in, it sensitizes the testicles to produce more testosterone and inhibits the conversion of testosterone to estrogen) these both occur at significantly higher oral doses than are seen with oral supplementation. Chrysin appears to be poorly absorbed, and even then it is readily metabolized resulting in insufficient levels in the blood and testes to exert these beneficial effects.
Chromium|Chromium is an essential mineral. It regulates glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Supplementing more chromium than the body needs does not produce reliable results, but it may be associated with minor benefits to diabetics.~~~~Chromium is an essential mineral, consumed through the diet. It is found in trace amounts in plant products, specifically grains.~~~~Chromium regulates insulin in the body. It is sometimes supplemented to improve insulin action in the body.~~~~When chromium is supplemented by people with normal or elevated chromium levels, no reliable effect is achieved. Besides a mild decrease in fasting glucose, no diabetes-related biomarkers are improved.~~~~People with a subclinical chromium deficiency (below optimal, but not a true deficiency) may experience benefits when supplementing chromium, but more research is required to confirm this effect. True chromium deficiencies, characterized by inactive chromodulin, are rare.~~~~Chromium’s main mechanism is directly tied to chromodulin. Chromodulin, a protein, normally augments the signaling of insulin receptors. If this protein is impaired, insulin’s ability to work in the body is greatly reduced.~~~~Though chromium supplementation is not effective for diabetics, taking chromium alongside a proven therapy may help fight depression and the snacking associated with binge eating. Further research is needed to determine chromium’s exact mechanism during these effects.
Chondroitin|Chondroitin is a supplement frequently paired with Glucosamine as a combination therapy to help with joint pain and stiffness, and other symptoms of osteoarthritis.~~~~Chondroitin is a supplement, frequently used in conjunction with glucosamine, to combat the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA).~~~~A recent surge of meta-analyses (studies researching other studies) found that most studies that showed benefit with chondroitin were poorly designed or subject to chance statistical error (due to low amount of participants). Larger studies (which are seen as more reliable) tend to show no benefits with chondroitin nor glucosamine supplementation in isolation or combined.~~~~Although many people do report benefit from using this supplement (especially when paired with Glucosamine), the current body of scientific literature does not hold these two supplements in high regard.
Choline|Choline is a molecule mostly used for either its cognitive boosting properties (turning into acetylcholine, the learning neurotransmitter) or as a liver health agent, able to reduce fatty liver buildup. Found in high amounts in eggs, the yolks in particular.
Chlorophytum borivilianum|Chlorophytum borivilianum (Safed Musli) is a Rasayana herb from Indian Medicine supposedly used as an aphrodisiac and adaptogen. Mostly rat studies currently, but it appears to be an effective erectogenic agent and aphrodisiac.~~~~Chlorophytum Borivilianum (Safed Musli) is a traditionally rare Indian herb used in Ayurveda that was normally procured in jungles, but has since begun to be cultivated; it has usage as an adaptogenic compound and aphrodisiac and is sometimes referred to as White Gold due to the coloration, or lack thereof, or its roots which are seen as the main active component. Safed Musli has a high saponin and polysaccharide content, and the water extract appears to be the most active extraction (with some efficacy coming from alcoholic or methanolic).~~~~In regards to the state of research, it currently has a fair bit of animal studies while human studies are lacking; the two human studies currently on Examine are both confounded with the inclusion of equal parts Mucuna Pruriens and, which promising, have funding from a company that produces the compound used. These results need to be taken with skepticism.~~~~In rats, Safed Musli appears to be quite an effective aphrodisiac and pro-erectile agent that (at least according to one study) was slightly less effective than Viagra; Safed Musli also appears to be called Herbal Viagra by some, which is similar to the name given to Cnidium Monnieri (a proerectile agent from Traditional Chinese Medicine). Like many other aphrodisiac herbs, spermatogenesis and testicular size can be increased; no sexual effect of Safed Musli has been tested in humans, although comparative studies against Asparagus Racemosus and Curculigo Orchioides suggest that Safed Musli is the most potent of these three herbs.
Chlorogenic Acid|Chlorogenic acid is found in coffee mostly and a lot of plant compounds; it holds promise in many aspects of health and cognition similar to bioflavonoids and shares some effects similar to caffeine but less potent. May decrease the absorption of dietary carbohydrate.~~~~Chlorogenic acid is a phytochemical found in coffee and coffee beans. It has been touted as being able to reduce blood sugar levels and potentially exert an anti-diabetic effect. It has also been implicated in weight loss and exerting an anti-obesity effect, but that is insofar correlation and not necessarily due to chlorogenic acid.~~~~It can be beneficial to supplement, although doses found in food sources are enough for a long-term preventative (anti-diabetic) measure.
Chlorella|Chlorella is a freshwater algae that is commonly supplemented by vegan populations (similar to Spirulina). Chlorella appears to be a bioavailable source of both Iron and Vitamin B12, and may have other benefits.
Centrophenoxine|Centrophenoxine is to DMAE like Alpha-GPC is to Choline, an option that is better absorbed since the active molecule is bound to an absorption enhancer. Centrophenoxine carries the benefits of DMAE, and may boost cognition in the elderly.~~~~Centrophenoxine is a cholinergic compound with a DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol) component, and acts as a better absorbed transporter of DMAE into the brain. It is sold under the brand name Lucidril but can easily be bought over the counter or online.~~~~It is effective in reversing some of the signs of aging (particularly waste product buildup in the brain) when taken for an acute period (high doses for a month) and can act as a general neural enhancer and protector when taken continuously at a lower dose.
Centella asiatica|Centella asiatica (Gotu Kola) is a traditional medicine mainly renowned for its cognitive enhancing properties (usually alongside bacopa monnieri) and its ability to regenerate wound healing. It appears effective on both parameters in preclinical evidence, and may also be anti-rheumatic.~~~~Centella asiatica (Gotu Kola) is a traditional medicine that is mostly used and renowned in Ayurveda but has some usage in Traditional chinese usage as well. It is most commonly known as a cognitive enhancing supplement that is somewhat 'interchangeable' with Bacopa monnieri (insofar that the two share many of the same names) but has additional benefits for cardiovascular health (in particular, chronic venous insufficiency), skin regeneration rates and wound healing, and possible benefits to anxiety and rheumatism.~~~~In regards to its cognitive enhancing properties, it requires a few weeks to work and seems to cause an increase in neuronal growth (not how many neurons there are, but how far their dendrites branch out). This is due to activating a class of proteins known as MAPKs, which causes a release in a growth factor for neurons called Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). This is a mechanism somewhat similar to Bacopa monnieri and the time-delay in improving cognition is also similar; however, currently there are no studies assessing whether they can be used alongside each other or which one is more potent.~~~~It has another independent mechanism where it augments the release of an anti-inflammatory signalling molecule from immune cells, in particular it enhances the secretion of the molecule known as IL-1β from the immune cells known as macrophages; it does this at a remarkably low concentration (in the picomolar range) and is likely relevant to oral supplementation, and if so this could partly explain benefits to chronic venous insuffiency (which are quite proven with human evidence) and its anti-rheumatic benefits (not as proven).~~~~Finally, this plant may inhibit a group of enzymes that break down collagen while simultanously increasing the rate that collagen is synthesized; this is thought to underlie the increase in wound healing rate (which is proven in animal research with preliminary human research) and is thought to be the reason why centella asiatica is used as a skin tightening agent as any increase in collagen synthesis (like with creatine) should cause a firmness of the skin.
Celery seed extract|Celery seed oil is a supplement containing a high amount of volatile compounds known as phthalides. These compounds as well as the major component Sedanolide appear to have general antioxidative properties and have traditionally been used as a diuretic.
Celastrus paniculatus|Celastrus paniculatus is a plant, the seeds of which are used to improve cognition. Preliminary evidence suggests it is also a potent intestinal relaxant. Celastrus paniculatus is a woody fruit-bearing vine. The fruit of the plant contains seeds used in Ayurveda medicine.~~~~Celastrus paniculatus seeds are used to alleviate cognitive issues and promote intestinal health. The seeds can also be made into an oil, which is sometimes used during massage. The oil is used to alleviate skin inflammation and has a mild sedative effect.~~~~Studies done on rats suggest that Celastrus paniculatus seeds can also reduce cholesterol in unhealthy rats.~~~~Animal evidence suggests Celastrus paniculatus can protect the brain and improve cognition, but single dose supplementation is ineffective. The effect becomes stronger over two weeks of supplementation.~~~~Celastrus paniculatus seeds are a promising supplement for neurological and intestinal health, but much more research is needed before they can be specifically recommended for supplementation.
Casein Protein|Out of the 'curds and the whey' of milk, Casein protein is the curds. A dietary protein source with gel-forming capabilities, it is touted to be slowly absorbed in part due to slowing intestinal motility and gel-forming like fiber; adding water makes pudding. ~~~~Casein protein is one of the two proteins that make up dairy protein (the other being Whey protein). It is typically known as the 'slow' digesting component of milk protein.
Caralluma fimbriata|Caralluma Fimbriata is a certain species of the Caralluma genus that appears to have historical usage as a famine food, appetite suppressant, and thirst quencher when the vegetables are boiled and salted. Research is preliminary, but seems to validate these claims.
Capsicum Carotenoids|Carotenoids that are common to Capsicum foods like red peppers, and tend to co-exist alongside Capsaicin; not too bioactive, but appear to be potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors and may increase bioavailability of other supplements. Capsicum Carotenoids are two pigments from the Capsicum family of vegetables (most well known for peppers and cayenne, and to a lesser degree paprika). These pigmentations belong to the class of carotenoids, and are reddish in nature.~~~~They affect metabolism of other compounds and pharmaceuticals by acting as inhibitors of a class of proteins that eject some drugs and supplements from inside cells, and can also eject supplements from the liver back into the intestine. For supplements that are subject to these protein transports, inhibiting the transports increases the amount of supplement taken up by the body.
Capsaicin|The exact molecule found in hot peppers that burns your face off, acts via adrenaline receptors and TRPV1 (like Evodia) to increase heat quickly. Can burn body fat with minimal potency, fight inflammation with decent potency, and prevent cancer with indeterminate potency.
Calcium-D-Glucarate|Calcium-D-Glucarate is a β-glucuronidase inhibitor that promotes the excretion of any molecule in a specific detoxification pathway. It has shown efficacy at very high (impractical) oral doses in reducing cancer induced by these compounds, but may also reduce all steroid hormones as well.  For the most part, Calcium-D-Glucarate is just known to be a β-glucuronidase inhibitor via its metabolite D-glucaro-1,4-lactone. The process of 'glucuronidation' is a detoxification process where a group (known as a glucuronide) is attached to a hydrophobic molecule to make it more water soluble, and then the kidneys can better facilitate its removal from the body. This process is positively mediated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzyme, and negatively mediated by the β-glucuronidase enzyme; as such, inhibiting the negative regulator (the enzyme that removes the glucuronide) indirectly increases the activity of this pathway.~~~~It is touted to be an anticancer agent, which is due to a series of past research done in rats and mice exposed to the DMBA toxin which is known to be glucuronidated. There are definitely anticancer effects in these models, and it appears to extend to other toxins that are glucuronidated.~~~~However, a problem occurs when humans take this as an oral supplement. Although it appears to be safe even at high doses, very high doses are required for its effects (100mg/kg minimum, near maximal effects at 200mg/kg) and this would even only theoretically assure some protection against toxins that are glucuronidated. If a toxin is subject to another detoxification pathway (such as conjugation by glutathione) then Glucaric acid will serve no benefit.~~~~Organ cancer production which just occurs spontaneously because of oxidative stress to DNA is also not likely to be protected against, as increasing glucuronidation does not per se decrease oxidative stress in the body (it might just reduce the oxidative effects of toxins).~~~~Furthermore, all steroid hormones in the body (testosterone, estrogen, DHEA, etc.) are also glucuronidated. If using an oral dose that reduces the toxin, these hormones will also all be reduced for a short time.~~~~Using calcium-D-glucarate as a daily preventative supplement does not appear to be a prudent idea, due to its lack of reliability even in theory and high doses used. However, a single acute dose of this supplement prior to known exposure to toxins that are glucuronidated (such as both benzopyrene and polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds produced in the cooking of meat products) might be more prudent and potentially useful.
Calcium|Calcium is a dietary macromineral found in high amounts in dairy products, and to a lesser extent in vegetables. Used primarily to support bone health, calcium also has a role in maternal and cardiovascular health. Calcium is one of the 24 vitamins and minerals required for good health in the human body. It is a macromineral due to the relatively large amounts required in the diet (at times exceeding a gram a day) and is predominately found in dairy products and vegetables. Similar to many other nutrients, calcium does follow the general advice of "if the diet is sufficient in calcium then supplementation is unnecessary" and excessive intakes of calcium do not promote greater benefits to health and may simply promote constipation.~~~~The major benefit of calcium is preventative, mitigating the risk of developing osteoporosis during the aging process. Osteoporosis can be at least partially seen as a condition resulting from long-term calcium insufficiency and, while not fully preventative, maintaining adequate calcium intake throughout life is associated with significantly reduced risk.~~~~Calcium can come from any source be it supplementation, food, or even food-derivatives such as whey protein. Each form does have their benefits and drawbacks, such as coral calcium technically being better absorbed than calcium carbonate, but due to calcium's ability to be absorbed at all points in the intestine the issue of calcium absorption is one that is greatly influenced by the diet. Diets high in fermentable fibers (usually found in vegetables) and high enough in bulk and fiber to slow the rate at which food passes through the intestines increase calcium absorption; simply taking a calcium supplement on top of a low fiber/low bulk diet will not be as effective as consuming the calcium through dairy or even vegetables.
Caffeine|Caffeine is a stimulatory anti-sleep compound extracted from coffee beans. Habitual caffeine use leads to tolerance, which dulls several of caffeine’s effects.  What does caffeine do?~~Caffeine comes from coffee beans, but it can also be synthesized in a laboratory. It has the same structure whether it’s in coffee, energy drinks, tea or pills.~~~~Caffeine is a powerful stimulant, and it can be used to improve physical strength and endurance. It is classified as a nootropic because it sensitizes neurons and provides mental stimulation.~~~~Habitual caffeine use is also associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.~~~~Caffeine’s main mechanism concerns antagonizing adenosine receptors. Adenosine causes sedation and relaxation when it acts upon its receptors, located in the brain. Caffeine prevents this action and causes alertness and wakefulness. This inhibition of adenosine can influence the dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and adrenaline systems.~~~~Habitual caffeine use leads to tolerance. This means the effects of caffeine will be diminished, often to the point where the only benefit a user experiences is caffeine’s anti-sleep effect. This is an ‘insurmountable’ tolerance, which means more caffeine will not overcome it. A month-long break from caffeine will reduce tolerance.
Caesalpinia benthamiana|Caesalpinia benthamiana is an African herb used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. While research into this herb is beyond preliminary, it appears to be quite a potent aphrodisiac and may increase levels of nitric oxide production.    Caesalpinia benthamiana is a traditional medicine for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and is sometimes made into a paste with oils for the topical treatment of wounds and infections.~~~~There is very preliminary analysis into this plant, but it appears to be able to increase nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression in endothelial cells and is quite a potent aphrodisiac; pending more research into the latter claim it could potentially be a useful herb for sexual impotence in men.
CDP-choline|CDP-choline (citicholine) is a nootropic compound that converts to both choline and cytidine upon ingestion, the latter of which converts into uridine in the body. It appears to confer cognitive-promoting properties as a prodrug for these two compounds. CDP-choline is a nootropic compound that is essentially a prodrug for both choline and uridine, conferring both of those molecules to the body following oral ingestion of CDP-Choline. Specifically, the CDP-choline dissociates into choline and cytidine, with the cytidine then converting into uridine. CDP-choline is one of the three choline-containing phospholipids that can be orally supplemented (the other two being Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylcholine).~~~~This supplement is catered towards preventing or treating memory impairments associated with aging due to the fact that both of the molecules it confers are neuroprotective and potentially enhance learning. While it appears to be more effective than phosphatidylcholine (PC) at this role, in part due to also increasing PC synthesis in the brain, its potency is somewhat comparable to that of Alpha-GPC.~~~~CDP-choline has some other potential uses in relation to cognition. It is commonly used as a memory enhancer in youth, but despite some rodent studies suggesting that this is possible with oral CDP-choline, there are no human studies in youth at this point in time. One study has noted an increase in attention with low dose CDP-choline (which needs to be replicated), and CDP-choline may have roles as an anti-addictive compound against both cocaine and (preliminary evidence suggests) food as well.
CBD|Why is CBD such a big deal? Two reasons. First, isolated CBD won't get you "high", unlike THC (the other main cannabinoid in cannabis). Second, isolated CBD has shown a ton of promise in animal research (anxiety, pain, inflammation, cancer, etc). Unfortunately, there are relatively few human trials as of 2019. And unregulated CBD often contains way lower or higher doses than the label states, sometimes even containing unlisted THC. Things are heating up though: in 2018, the FDA approved the first CBD pharmaceutical (Epidiolex®) for two rare types of epilepsy. ~~~~What is CBD?~~~~CBD (cannabidiol) is the second most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis, after THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).[5] Isolated CBD is typically used medicinally, not recreationally, with the four most commonly targeted conditions being pain, anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders.[6]~~~~Is CBD legal?~~~~Let's just say ... it's complicated. CBD products that are derived from hemp, with a low-to-zero percentage of THC (below 0.3%), are currently in a legal gray area in the US.~~~~A quick bit of history: The Farm Act was passed in December of 2018, and it legalized hemp (the source of CBD).[7] CBD advocates rejoiced – CBD supplements were already commonplace in 2018, but now in 2019 they're pretty much everwhere. Some estimates suggest up to 7% of adults have used CBD, and there were up to $2 billion in sales in 2018 (projected to rise dramatically in the next couple years).~~~~In December of 2018 though, the FDA stated that CBD cannot be marketed as a supplement without FDA approval, but in April of 2019, the FDA was taking public comments to formulate a revised position.[8] Currently, non-pharmaceutical CBD is technically only legal under very specific conditions, such as when the source hemp was produced in a manner consistent with the Farm Bill, and by a licensed grower. Complicating matters further: the DEA and individual states can have different legal perspectives on CBD. Clarification on CBD legality should come within the first half of 2019.~~~~As far as 100% unquestionably legal CBD goes, the liquid CBD medication Epidiolex was recently FDA-approved in 2018. Note that it's not the first cannabis extract drug. Nabiximols (brand name Sativex) is a cannabis extract spray with a nearly 1:1 ratio of THC:CBD, and it was approved as a drug in the UK in 2010 (but has not been approved in the US). Due to the THC content, it has a different side effect profile than Epidiolex, such as dizziness and disorientation.[9] However, due to the THC, it may have benefits for a wider variety of conditions than CBD alone (due to the "entourage effect"), such as for spasticity from multiple sclerosis.[10]~~~~What are CBD's potential benefits?~~~~The main studied benefit to CBD is on two rare forms of epilepsy (Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome),[11] but potential benefits stretch from common maladies (anxiety,[12] chronic pain[13]) to reduction in inflammation[14], even to potential benefits for cancer.[15] Human randomized trials are quite scarce, though.~~~~Before protesting, "Hey, why doesn't your Scientific Research section cover XYZ mouse study showing CBD benefits?", take note that mice are not human. In fact, the same exact dose of CBD in a mouse versus a human will be more bioavailable in the mouse, leading to larger effects.[16] That's besides the bevy of other reasons that animal studies often don't translate to humans, such as different metabolic pathways in animals, lab conditions differing from free-living human conditions, etc.[17] ~~~~Is CBD dangerous?~~~~In small amounts, probably not for most people. In large amounts over time ... well, read on to get a gist of the risks.~~~~The most notable (acute) drawbacks of cannabis consumption don't apply to isolated CBD: a possible mind-altered state involving one or more of impaired memory, altered judgment, and impaired coordination.[18] Side effects of CBD are typically relatively minor, including fatigue, decreased appetite, and diarrhea.[19]~~~~Yet CBD is not without potential detriment. The long-term use of isolated CBD isn't well researched in humans, so potential harms may be possible. For example, CBD and cannabis in general has been touted as a potential cancer treatment,[20] yet certain cancer types could theoretically worsen from CBD-induced receptor activation (in this study, colon cancer).[21] CBD studies are typically very short term, and side effects are captured as part of studies exploring potential benefits. It would take months- or years-long studies to assess long-term risk of chronic ingestion on specific body systems.~~~~Despite this, CBD appears to be much safer than many other treatments aimed at chronic pain and anxiety, as well as drugs used for recreational use. In fact, the World Health Organization concluded in a review: "to date, there is no evidence of recreational use of CBD or any public health-related problems associated with the use of pure CBD".[22]~~~~How exactly does CBD work?~~~~The myriad ways in which it works are not fully understood, but do not appear to center on the CB1 and CB2 receptors that THC acts on. Those receptors are part of the relatively newly-discovered endocannabinoid system, first described in 1992,[23] and increasingly found to be important to human health and well-being through maintaining homeostasis (balance) in various aspects of physiology.[24][25][26][27] CBD actually opposes the action of THC at the CB1 receptor (and certain other receptors as well), which can help counter THC's (potential) worsening of cognition, memory, psychosis, and other effects.[28][29] Most notably, you won't get "high" (at least in the conventional sense of the word) from CBD, due to its differential impact on CB1 compared to THC.[30]~~~~Anywho, back to CBD's main effects. It appears to impact a variety of other receptors in the body, including an important receptor involved in pain and stress response, called TRPV1.[31][32][33] Other receptors that CBD impacts include GPR55, 5HTI-alpha, and adenosine A2A, which variously can help with inflammation, pain, anxiety, and even potentially cancer.[34][35][36][37] ~~~~There's a big catch though! CBD often seems to work better with THC (basically, in the typically consumed or inhaled form of medical cannabis, rather than as isolated CBD). This is often referred to as the "entourage effect" – that a single ingredient might, maybe do a little something, but you need the whole crew of compounds in the plant to have full efficacy.[38] The problem here is that the whole crew can make you high, which is not typically desired in continuously-taken medications, and may even increase the risk of psychosis with longer term use.[39]
Butea superba|Butea Superba (Red Kwao Krua) is a herb from Thai medicine sometimes thought to be the male equivalent of Pueraria Mirifica, a phytoestrogen known as White Kwao Krua; evidence for Butea Superba for these claims is lacking. Butea Superba is a tuber vegetable that looks visibly similar to Pueraria Mirifica yet appears to be opposite in effect. This tuber has traditionally been used for the enhancement of male vitality and as an aphrodisiac in Thailand, and appears to be a source of androgenic compounds.~~~~When studies investigated the androgenic effects, there appears to be the classical signs of direct androgenic activation (particularly, an increase in liver enzymes in some studies and growth of male sex organs; a decrease in testosterone levels in serum has been noted possibly due to negative feedback) but unlike its sister herb (Pueraria Mirifica) the bioactives mediating these androgenic effects are not currently known nor are their potencies relative to testosterone known.~~~~Low doses of Butea Superba appear to be safe for human consumption, based on limited evidence, although higher doses have been connected to mutagenicity in mice (300-1000mg/kg, a human equivalent of 48mg/kg or above) and as such are not advisable.~~~~Both studies on Butea Superba and its erectogenic effects appear to have their flaws, so although this herb could potentially be an erectogenic aid it is currently not proven to do so.
Butea monosperma|Butea monosperma is a herb that contains a variety of methoxylated isoflavones, and some of these isoflavones (cajanin) and other bioactives such as medicarpin can preserve bone mass with a potency similar or greater than estrogen itself, although some are nonestrogenic. Butea monosperma is a traditional Indian medicinal tree that also serves as an ornamental tree due to its vibrant red flowers that it bears, resulting in the common name of 'Flame of the Forest'. It appears to mostly be recommended as a general health tonic and for the treatment of liver disorders.~~~~The potential uses for this plant seem wholly different from its traditional uses, as it has shown some potential antidiabetic effects in rats (which need to be further investigated since we have no clue how they exert their benefits at this moment in time) but is most promising for the treatment of osteoporosis. A few flavonoids in this plant (Cajanin and Cladrin in particular) and one other molecule (Medicarpin) are structureally similar to isoflavones, and appear to be very potent at promoting bone health. Studies using these molecules in vitro have noted their effective doses compare with that of estrogen itself and they are just as potent (if not nonsignificantly more potent) at promoting bone growth; despite the potency, medicarpin is only slightly estrogenic and both Cajanin and Cladrin appear to be nonestrogenic.~~~~Cajanin, Cladrin, Medicarpin, and one other flavonoid known as Isoformononetin all appear to be highly active in rats following an oral dose of 10mg/kg (human equivalent of 1.6mg/kg), and have been noted to fully prevent bone losses assocaited with menopause with daily ingestion. Despite the potency observed, however, human studies have not yet been conducted.
Bulbine natalensis|Bulbine Natalensis is a traditionally used aphrodisiac and Testosterone Booster in South and South-Eastern Africa; in rat studies, it appears to both be quite potent in increasing testosterone but also appears to damage organ function in a similar manner to a steroid cycle. Bulbine Natalensis is an herb from Southern and South Eastern Africa that has traditionally been used as an aphrodisiac as well as some other beneficial properties. Due to its influences on cognition and sexuality, it is currently being investigated for its effects on testosterone.~~~~Three separate rat studies looking at serum testosterone levels note significant increases in circulating testosterone, and one study noted a decrease in estrogen levels as well. That being said, adverse effects have been reported on both the liver and kidneys with the exact same dosages seen to increase testosterone.
Bryonia laciniosa|An Ayurveda herb used traditionally as an aphrodisiac and pro-fertility compound, touted to increase masculinity and enhance youthfulness during aging. It belongs to the category of Vrishya rasayana alongside Anacyclus Pyrethrum. Bryonia Laciniosa is an Ayurvedic herb used traditionally as an aphrodisiac and pro-fertility compound, touted to increase masculinity and enhance youthfulness during aging. It belongs to the category of Vrishya rasayana alongside Anacyclus Pyrethrum.~~~~Research on this compound is preliminary, but it appears to be a potential testosterone booster as evidenced by one study done in rats.
Bromelain|Bromelain is an enzyme extracted from pineapples. It can reduce heart burn and act as a nasal decongestant. Bromelain, also called ‘pineapple extract,’ is a combination of several compounds, including a large amount of a special protein-digesting enzyme. This enzyme is able to be digested and thus affect the blood and body, rather than just the stomach and intestines.~~~~When Bromelain is in the stomach, it will help the body break down and digest protein. Supplementation of bromelain can also reduce nasal inflammation, meaning it acts as a decongestant.~~~~If taken between meals, bromelain can benefit the immune system and protect the body from cancer. Bromelain’s effects on fat cells are also under investigation, with promising preliminary evidence.~~~~Bromelain’s anti-inflammatory properties are responsible for several of its effects, including its ability to decongest the nasal cavity. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism through which bromelain survives the digestive system.~~~~There are many anecdotes that say bromelain supplementation will cause semen to taste like pineapple, but no studies have tested this claim.
Brassinosteroids|A bunch of 'plant steroid' molecules (like ecdysteroids are insect steroids) that are present in relatively high amounts in mustard; still nowhere near enough to get jacked off of mustard. Have not been shown to be effective in humans yet, remains an unexplored research field.  Brassinosteroids are a class of steroid compounds found in plants, used to regulate and induce plant growth. They share many similarities with human steroid hormones, but are generally at too low of a dose to exert effects in humans (on hormonal profiles) via food consumption.~~~~They have been implicated in mouse models on skeletal muscle growth, and in some cell lines show promise at being anti-carcinogens (cancer protective).
Brassica vegetables|A group of vegetables that are commonly associated with each other and share some bioactives, such as Diindolylmethane or Sulforaphane. Broccoli, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Mustard are Brassica veggies. A family of vegetables known for their anti-cancer and anti-estrogenic properties, as well as just being generally 'healthy'.~~~~They possess a set of compound unique to them, and may exert benefits through doses found in foods rather than supplementation.
Branched Chain Amino Acids|Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) are three amino acids that benefit muscle growth. They're not only found in supplements, but also in high levels in foods such as eggs or meat, rendering supplementation unnecessary for most people. Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) refers to three amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine.~~~~For people with low dietary protein intake, BCAA supplementation can promote muscle protein synthesis and increase muscle growth over time. Supplementation can also be used to prevent fatigue in novice athletes.~~~~Leucine plays an important role in muscle protein synthesis, while isoleucine induces glucose uptake into cells. Further research is needed to determine valine’s role in a BCAA supplement.~~~~Supplementing BCAAs prevents a serum decline in BCAAs, which occurs during exercise. A serum decline would normally cause a tryptophan influx into the brain, followed by serotonin production, which causes fatigue.~~~~BCAAs are important to ingest on a daily basis, but many protein sources, such as meat and eggs, already provide BCAAs. Supplementation is unnecessary for people with a sufficiently high protein intake (1-1.5g per kg of bodyweight a day or more).
Boswellia serrata|An Ayurvedic herb also classified as a phytopharmaceutical (H15; Europe) which appears to be quite anti-inflammatory, helpful against osteoarthritis, and may help cerebral edema. Boswellia serrata appears to have preliminary evidence for anti-inflammatory joint disorders. Boswellia Serrata is a gum resin extracted from a tree, which is sometimes burnt (the entire species of Boswellia is commonly known as Frankinsence) as an aromatic or otherwise administered as medicine. It has most usage for medicine in Ayurvedic medicine, some reading into Traditional Chinese Medicine, and its usage extends to the Middle East and other tropical regions.~~~~Boswellia Serrata, via its active boswellic acids, appears to be a novel inhibitory of a pro-inflammatory enzyme called 5-Lipoxygenase and may possess other anti-inflammatory effects (such as nF-kB inhibition, which are not as novel). These anti-inflammatory effects have been investigated for their benefits in osteoarthritis (OA), and it appears that oral Boswellia supplements can suppress pain and immobility associated with OA quite significantly with the effects taking as little as a week to occur. The studies are well conducted, but funded by the producers of the tested supplements. There are limited non-funded interventions with Boswellic for this claim, but they seem to agree with the battery of funded study in effect size.~~~~Remarkably, Boswellia appears to be quite anti-cancer that appears to be more anti-proliferative rather than apoptotic (the latter meaning to induce regulated cell death) since it is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and cell invasiveness. There are not a large battery of studies on these claims, but preliminary mouse and rat evidence where the rodents are injected with tumors suggest that Boswellia can potently suppress tumor growth (Pancreatic, Colorectal) and in some cases actually outright prevent tumor growth (Prostatic, Glioma). Boswellia appears to be a very promising anti-cancer herb due to the potency it exhibits in animals, with one study noting this after oral administration (100mg/kg of the main boswellic acid in animals). The potency has been replicated in other cancer cell lines in vitro (including breast, cervical, myeloma and leukemia) but these cancers do not yet have animal interventions yet.~~~~Boswellia appears to be fairly nontoxic, has a history of usage as a phytopharmaceutical for brain edema associated with radiotherapy (a cancer treatment), and the general anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects make it a fairly interesting herb relative to others that have subpar evidence.
Boron|Boron is a dietary mineral which is claimed to increase testosterone when supplemented at doses higher than from food.
Boerhaavia diffusa|Boerhaavia diffusa is an herb with anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. Boerhaavia diffusa is an herb found in Ayurveda and other traditional medicines. Historically, Boerhaavia diffusa has been used for its anti-diabetic and diuretic properties. In different areas of the world, Boerhaavia diffusa has also been used for pain relief, anti-inflammation, and treating indigestion. Boerhaavia diffusa is a tropical crawling root plant, with bioactive compounds in both the leaves and roots.~~~~There have not been any human studies conducted on Boerhaavia diffusa, but animal evidence suggests it is an effective diuretic, and can suppress the proliferation of immune cells. This can be harmful in some cases, like during flu season, but beneficial if the immune system is hyperactive. Boerhaavia diffusa also has an anti-proliferative effect on some cancer cells, which means it prevents them from spreading. This anti-cancer effect comes from the isolated bioactive purnavarine.~~~~Boerhaavia diffusa also has anti-oxidant properties.~~~~Boerhaavia diffusa’s anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative mechanisms are plausible explanations for _Boerhaavia diffusa’s potent anti-diabetic effects, which rivals the potency of standard drugs like Glibenclamide and Metformin. Further research is needed to confirm this relationship.
Blueberry|Blueberries are a fruit that contain a lot of molecules called anthocyanins. These antioxidant compounds are often supplemented for their ability to improve cognition.  Blueberries are a small, blue-purple fruit that belong to the genus vaccinium, which also includes cranberries and bilberries.~~~~Blueberries are a popular food and frequently supplemented. The antioxidant and anthocyanin content of blueberries makes them particularly effective at reducing cognitive decline, supporting cardiovascular health, protecting the liver, and reducing liver fat buildup.~~~~Blueberries may also have a potential nootropic effect. They have been found to improve cognition in people undergoing cognitive decline, but there is also some rodent evidence that suggests blueberries can improve cognition in healthy young people as well. They may also have a role to play in promoting the growth of nervous tissue and reducing neurological inflammation.~~~~Blueberries can be eaten or supplemented through blueberry powder. Isolated anthocyanins are also an effective supplement. Blueberries are both a food product and dietary supplement.
Bladderwrack|Bladderwrack is a species of seaweed known as Fucus vesiculosus that serves as a foodstuff and a source of Fucoxanthin, it is though to increase the metabolism via the thyroid but that is due to fixing iodine deficiencies historically. Bladderwrack (formal name Fucus Vesiculosis) is a brown seaweed which is a good source of iodine (the mineral needed for proper thyroid function) and of various L-fucose compounds.~~~~Said L-fucose compounds can be seen as generally being anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-carcinogenic. There are also some implications of them being anti-viral and anti-diabetic.~~~~Benefits can be seen from ingesting brown seaweeds as foodstuffs, or by consuming the L-fucose compounds or the seaweed itself in supplemental form; although the latter should be taken alongside food.
Black Pepper|Black Pepper is a source of piperine, a molecule that does not do much on its own but can inhibit enzymes that would attack other molecules. Due to this, it is ingested alongside some supplements to increase their absorption rates and is almost always consumed with curcumin. Black Pepper is a spice commonly used in many areas of the world for flavor. Through its active component Piperine, Black Pepper is able to modify supplement and drug metabolism.~~~~A process in the liver called glucuronidation, which attaches a molecule (glucuronide) to drugs to signal for their urinary excretion, is inhibited with piperine. This process prevents excessive levels of drugs and supplements in the body, but sometimes inhibits all uptake and renders some supplements useless. In the scenario of piperine ingestion, excretion of supplements is hindered and certain drugs and supplements can bypass this regulatory stage (as not all are subject to it).~~~~This is good in some cases, as Piperine is required to give curcumin to the extremities rather than it getting consumed by glucuronidation in the liver. However, in some other cases it can lead to elevated levels of certain drugs in the blood. Again, elevated could be good or bad depending on context; regardless, caution should be taken when approaching this compound.
Black Cohosh|Black Cohosh is the most popular supplement for menopause in North America, but the human studies are mixed. Pretty down the middle, and placebo effect seems to play a great deal in these studies. It holds some benefit for controlling hot flashes and night sweats, but does not appear very potent. Black Cohosh is a herb native to North America that has traditionally been used for cognitive and inflammatory conditions, but has grown in popularity due to it's ability to treat vasomotor symptoms of menopause; primarily hot flashes and night sweats. It is one of the most popular and highest sold supplements in the Western world (10th place in 2008), according to some surveys.~~~~Studies on the matter are highly mixed. The larger body of evidence favors the efficacy of Black Cohosh for treatment of vasomotor symptoms but consists largely of unblinded studies; as the placebo effect can reduce menopausal complaints, blinding is needed. Efficacy has been demonstrated with blinded studies on Black Cohosh as well, but many of them are confounded with consumption of other compounds. A few blinded studies on Black Cohosh without any other compounds have been conducted, and are basically split right down the middle on efficacy if not favoring 'no significant effects' a little bit more due to quality of data and sample size.~~~~Beyond the questionable efficacy, Black Cohosh appears to be safe. It is non-estrogenic (despite being thought to influence estrogen in the past) and may act centrally (in the brain) via serotonin, dopamine or opioids. Stomach upset has been reported and seems to be attributable to Black Cohosh in some people, but reports of liver toxicity do not appear to be related to the Black Cohosh herb. These reports do exist, but they cannot be linked to Black Cohosh logically.
Biotin|Biotin is one of the essential B vitamins used by the body primarily as an enzymatic cofactor. While it is popular as a beauty supplement for hair, skin, and nails and very preliminary evidence suggests it may have a role in these uses, its role is not well supported. Potential interactions with diabetes are also not well understood. Biotin is an essential vitamin that has been grouped with the B-complex vitamins since it was discovered, in yeast alongside other B vitamins. Although it is technically known as vitamin B7, this designation is not too common as it is usually simply referred to as biotin.~~~~It was initially found to be a component of nails, skin, and hair to a relatively high degree. Biotin has been seen as the go-to vitamin for beauty ever since one pilot study in women with brittle nails showed supplementation to be beneficial. It is currently being marketed for improving nail, skin, and hair aesthetics. These claims, however, were not followed up scientifically so there is not much evidence to support biotin's role here. It can plausibly have these actions mechanistically, but there is simply not much evidence that can be used as support.~~~~Beyond that, biotin's general role as an enzymatic cofactor has also led to some research suggesting it may interact with glucose metabolism in the human body. As a general statement it seems that in rodents with a higher circulating biotin level in their blood, the amount of insulin released in response to a glucose test is higher, leading to less elevation of glucose over time. This rodent evidence also suggests that the higher glucose is not met with higher insulin resistance suggesting a potentially beneficial role.~~~~Not too much evidence has been conducted in humans in regard to diabetes, with one study finding that intramuscular biotin was able to attenuate symptoms of neuropathy in three diabetic subjects.~~~~Overall, aside from instances where biotin may be deficient (alcoholism, some epileptic drug therapies, and overconsumption of raw egg whites) the supplement does not have any solid evidence for benefits and may have a role as a beauty supplement pending better evidence.
Betalains|Betalains are a group of reddish pigments found in some fruits where the red anthocyanin compounds (such as pelargonidin) are replaced with betalains; a major component of beet root, it can dye the urine a reddish tint.  Betalain consumption (particularly from beets) can color both the urine and feces red, leading to misdiagnosis of rhabdomyolysis and colon damage if assessed by the naked eye; similarly, frequent consumption of beets may be able to 'mask' the main symptom of rhabdomyolysis which is blood in the urine
Beta-Alanine|Beta-alanine is the building block of carnosine, a molecule that helps buffer acid in muscles, increasing physical performance in the 60–240-second range. Beta-alanine can aid lean-mass gain. Carnosine appears to be an antioxidant and anti-aging compound.  Beta-alanine is a modified version of the amino acid alanine.~~~~Beta-alanine has been shown to enhance muscular endurance. Many people report being able to perform one or two additional reps in the gym when training in sets of 8–15 repetitions. Beta-alanine supplementation can also improve moderate- to high-intensity cardiovascular exercise performance, like rowing or sprinting.~~~~When beta-alanine is ingested, it turns into the molecule carnosine, which acts as an acid buffer in the body. Carnosine is stored in cells and released in response to drops in pH. Increased stores of carnosine can protect against diet-induced drops in pH (which might occur from ketone production in ketosis, for example), as well as offer protection from exercise-induced lactic acid production.~~~~Large doses of beta-alanine may cause a tingling feeling called paresthesia. It is a harmless side effect.
Berberine|Berberine is a alkaloid extracted from a variety of herbs. It is supplemented for its anti-diabetic effects, which rival the potency of some pharmaceuticals, though still require more research for a proper comparison. What is berberine?~~Berberine is an alkaloid extracted from various plants used in traditional Chinese medicine. It's primarily used to reduce insulin resistance and improve biomarkers of type II diabetes such as fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin. Berberine can activate an enzyme called Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) while inhibiting Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), thus increasing insulin sensitivity. Other possible mechanisms of action include protecting and β-cells, regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis, and reducing inflammatory cytokine signaling.~~~~~~What are the benefits of berberine?~~Human and animal research demonstrates that 1500mg of berberine, taken in three doses of 500mg each, is equally effective as taking 1500mg of metformin or 4mg glibenclamide, two pharmaceuticals for treating type II diabetes. Effectiveness was measured by how well the drugs reduced biomarkers of type II diabetes. It should be noted that although there's a fair bit of research suggesting strong effects of berberine for reducing biomarkers of type II diabetes, it's is still less supported by research than many pharmaceuticals and it's unclear what its long-term effects on mortality and complications are.~~~~Some evidence suggests that it can reduce LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides in type II diabetics, and possibly lead to a small increase in HDL-cholesterol.~~~~~~What are berberine's side-effects and drawbacks?~~Berberine has a high potential to interact with medications, and some interactions may be severe. It is generally safe in normal doses, but more long-term research on its safety is needed. Gastrointestinal upset can occur when high doses are used, and due to its ability to reduce blood sugar, it may increase the risk for hypoglycemia in high doses, though this isn't a common occurance.~~~~~~Is berberine safe to take?~~Tentatively, yes, but a doctor's guidance is highly recommended. Berberine has been the subject of much research and seems to be potent like many pharmaceuticals, but unlike the most well-researched pharmaceuticals, its long-term safety and frequent adverse effects haven't been sufficiently evaluated.
Benfotiamine|Benfotiamine is a relative of the vitamin Thiamine (B1) that appears to have a therapeutic role in pain reduction and diabetic complications (neuropathies and nephropathies); confers bioavailable Vitamin B1 after oral ingestion.
Beet Root|Beet root (usually as juice) is a supplement with a high nitrate content that is said to improve physical performance secondary to nitric oxide. It appears to have some evidence for this claim in healthy athletes.
Basella alba|Basella Alba is a herb used commonly alongside Hibiscus macranthus for the purpose of fertility. The combination has been found to increase testosterone in rats, and Basella appears to be more active in this regard.
Banaba Leaf|Lagerstroemia, also known as Banaba, is a plant whose leaves have been used for anti-diabetic purposes. It contains a variety of molecules such as corosolic acid which may confer benefit to glucose control. Lagerstroemia is the species of plant commonly known as Banaba. It is a herb with a blend of compounds that, holistically, seem to be catered towards being anti-diabetic in nature.~~~~It can inhibit uptake (digestion and absorption) of carbohydrates to a degree, and can also aid in their deposition into cells from the blood stream (resulting in a reduction in blood sugar).
Bacopa monnieri|Bacopa monnieri is a nootropic herb that has been used in traditional medicine for longevity and cognitive enhancement. Supplementation can reduce anxiety and improve memory formation. Bacopa monnieri, commonly known as water hyssop, is an herb often used in Ayurveda.~~~~Supplementing Bacopa monnieri has been shown to improve cognition, by means of reducing anxiety. It is also reliable for improving memory formation. Though effects of this nature are usually studied in the elderly, Bacopa monnieri appears to affect young people as well, making it a useful nootropic.~~~~Since Bacopa monnieri is also an adaptogen, a relaxed person might experience a lack of motivation to work after supplementation. Theoretically, pairing Bacopa monnieri with a stimulant would ward off malaise, but this combination has not been tested.~~~~Bacopa monnieri interacts with the dopamine and serotonergic systems, but its main mechanism concerns promoting neuron communication. It does this by enhancing the rate at which the nervous system can communicate by increasing the growth of nerve endings, also called dendrites. Bacopa monnieri is also an antioxidant.~~~~Taking Bacopa monnieri on an empty stomach may cause nausea, cramping, bloating, and diarrhea.
BPC-157|BPC-157 is a synthetic peptide that is being investigated for its regenerative effects. It shows high efficacy for rats suffering toxic or surgical trauma, but there is currently no evidence that it provides benefits for people.~~BPC-157 is a peptide chain consisting of 15 amino acids. It is considered synthetic because this particular sequence does not exist in nature. It is derived from a protective protein found in the stomach.~~~~Researchers have conducted numerous rodent studies on BPC-157 that show it has protective effects extending beyond the stomach and intestinal tract. BPC-157 has been shown to benefit ulcers in the stomach, intestinal damage such as fistulas and inflammatory disorders, bone and joint healing and growth rates, and organ damage. It also has some influences on the brain. Researchers have observed marked protective effects when BPC-157 is administired to rats alongside a research toxin or damaging surgical procedure.~~~~More research is needed to clarify whether BPC-157 has multiple mechanisms of action, but current research suggests BPC-157 influences several growth factors usually involved in angiogenesis (the production of blood vessels) and other factors involved in regeneration following damage.~~~~BPC-157 shows promise, but human studies are needed to demonstrate that these benefits extend beyond research animals.~~~~The majority of studies on BPC-157 are done on rats given injections of the supplement. While BPC-157 is a stable peptide, peptides are a group of compounds that are normally poorly absorbed after oral supplementation, so researchers use injections in rodent studies instead. Furthermore, there is no human evidence for BPC-157 and the majority of the research has been conducted by a single research group. Due to its synthetic nature, there may be legal issues associated with the sale of this supplement in certain regions and it may be banned by some sport organizations.
Ayurveda|Ayurveda is a branch of medicine originating from India that focuses on oral ingestion of herbs and other supplements for optimal health; similar to Traditional Chinese Medicine, these herbs are being validated scientifically for their historical claims. Ayurveda is the branch of traditional medicine which was localized to India and nearby countries, and similar to Traditional Chinese Medicine in that the 'medicines' used traditionally conists of mostly herbs but also some other things that may be bioactive.~~~~The term Ayurveda is derived from 'Ayus' (life) and 'Ved' (knowledge) as was to refer to accumulated knowledge and practise of sustaining and improving human life and the body.~~~~The section devoted to herbs, alchemy, and chemistry is called Rasayan, and is what Ayurvedic supplementation belongs to.
Astragalus membranaceus|Astragalus membranaceus is one of the fifty fundamental herbs in traditional Chinese medicine. It is used for a variety of purposes and supposedly increases lifespan. It has anti-inflammatory effects and is especially beneficial for the kidneys. Astragalus membranaceus is an important herb in traditional Chinese medicine. It has been used in a wide variety of herbal blends and ‘natural’ remedies, including Dang-gui buxue tang, which is Astragalus membranaceus paired with Angelicae Sinensis.~~~~Astragalus membranaceus has been researched for its cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and longevity effects.~~~~Though Astragalus membranaceus supplementation has been shown to reduce the metabolic and physical complications of aging, there are currently no studies that show an actual increase in lifespan. The flavonoid content of Astragalus membranaceus may also contribute to its cardioprotective effects. Its polysaccharide content also protects the heart because it is a potent anti-inflammatory agent, and it is able to reduce cholesterol levels, similar to psyllium husk, which is a fiber supplement.~~~~The main mechanism of Astragalus membranaceus is a result of its active ingredients. The main component is astragaloside IV, which has been extracted, isolated and patented under the name TA-65 and marketed as a longevity agent. Unfortunately, astragaloside IV has a low bioavailability, meaning it doesn’t circulate well through the body after being ingested. This means it can only be present in the body at low concentrations. Still, low concentrations of astragaloside IV can provide cardioprotective effects. Several studies done on astragaloside IV have conflicting sources of funding, and while that doesn’t invalidate the results, replication by a third party would go a long way toward confirming the effects of astragaloside IV.~~~~Astragalus membranaceus supplementation can provide a variety of health benefits, but may not actually prolong lifespan. Like resveratrol, Astragalus membranaceus is a compound that adds life to your years, rather than adding years to your life.
Asteracantha longifolia|Asteracantha longifolia (Kokilaaksha) is an ayurvedic aphrodisiac and liver protective agent. Currently, research on this plant is preliminary with limited information on both components of the plant and toxicology. Asteracantha longifolia (synonymous with quite a few other plant and traditional names) is a traditional Indian medicine that is reported to be beneficial against glucose disturbances (Diabetes) and against liver problems; in addition to these two therapeutic claims, it is reported to be a diuretic and an aphrodisiac.~~~~At this moment in time there is not much information on this herb, but it appears to have some interactions with glucose metabolism in the sense that it can augment glycogen synthesis in the liver and muscle tissue (mechanism unknown) and it appears to protect the liver and brain from lipid peroxidation with a potency somewhat comparable to Vitamin E.
Astaxanthin|Astaxanthin is an aquatic carotenoid like fucoxanthin, but is the red pigment in salmon and krill; the most stable of all carotenoids and touted to aid in eye health and inflammation. Limited human evidence, but it appears to be a better carotenoid than the more researched lutein and zeaxanthin. Astaxanthin is a red-pink pigment found in various seafoods, and also in the feathers of flamingos and quails. It is structurally similar to beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A) but has some chemical differences which may be safer.~~~~It seems to be able to improve many blood parameters that could be beneficial to heart disease. At doses of 6-8mg daily, it can decrease the oxidation of LDL cholesterol and prevent it from becoming artherogenic (artery clogging). It can increase general blood flow and reduce blood sugar in diabetics and blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (humans not studied yet) with no effect on these measures in normal healthy persons.~~~~Additionally, it is also a potent anti-inflammatory and has more anti-oxidant capabilities than vitamin A itself.
Asparagus racemosus|Asparagus racemosus is an herb used in Ayurveda medicine. It is not the commonly consumed vegetable, but it is a related plant. Asparagus racemosus is an herb used in Ayurveda medicine. It is not the vegetable usually called asparagus.~~~~Supplementing Asparagus racemosus will aid digestion, since the plant has anti-ulcer effects. It will also aid the immune system when antibodies are fighting off a threat. Asparagus racemosus also has aphrodisiac, antidepressant and anxiety-reducing effects.~~~~But for anxiety, depression and libido, Asparagus racemosus is outclassed by other herbs. For example, Ashwagandha is more effective at reducing anxiety and depression, while Panax ginseng provides more physical benefits.~~~~Though Asparagus racemosus has been used as a galactagogue to increase breast milk production, this area needs further research before Asparagus racemosus supplementation can be specifically recommended.
Ashwagandha|Ashwagandha has been called the king of Ayurvedic herbs. Limited research suggests that it works well for reducing stress and anxiety. It may also modestly enhance strength performance, improve glucose metabolism, and increase testosterone levels, but more research is needed to confirm this.  What is Ashwagandha?~~Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is an herb used in Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India. Its root has a horsey smell (in Sanskrit, ashva means “horse” and gandha means “smell”) and is said to confer the strength and virility of a horse. Various parts of the plant are used, but the most common in supplements is an extract of its roots.~~~~~~What are Ashwagandha's benefits?~~A number of studies suggest that it has anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects; studies are mostly supportive of a notable effect of ashwagandha for this purpose, and it seems to reduce cortisol levels. However, more research is needed before we can have a great deal of confidence in it or know the optimal dose. Ashwagandha may also be able to reduce insomnia, fatigue, and the symptoms of depression, but it hasn't been well-researched for these purposes.~~~~It may increase power output in untrained subjects during resistance exercise and anaerobic running, but this observation is based on a small amount of research and more is needed. It may lead to small reductions in blood glucose, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol, while slightly increasing HDL-cholesterol. Additionally, it may modestly increase testosterone and sperm quality in infertile men.~~~~~~What are Ashwagandha's side effects and drawbacks?~~It seems to be safe, but it needs more long-term research that's specifically designed to evaluate its safety. It may cause mild drowsiness and sedation for some people.~~~~~~Can I take Ashwagandha daily?~~This question is difficult to answer because we currently lack a lot of long-term information from clinical trials. Because of its possible drug-like effects on neurotransmission, it's difficult to rule out unintended side-effects or a loss of potency in the long-term. However, what studies we do have generally suggest that the effects of Ashwagandha on stress/anxiety continually improve for at least for two months after the beginning of daily supplementation. Furthermore, the studies use Ashwagandha daily, and if a study finds an effect, the best way to get that same effect is to mimic the dose and dosing schedule in the study. Tt is unknown if taking breaks from Ashwagandha or taking it every other day will yield the same effects.
Ascophyllum nodosum|Ascophyllum nodosum is a species of seaweed. It is being investigated for its immunostimulatory properties and it may inhibit carbohydrate absorption after supplementation. Ascophyllum nodosum is a species of seaweed found around the globe. It is one of the many species of seaweed called kelp.~~~~Ascophyllum nodosum contains compounds called phlorotannins, which are unique to seaweed and may be able to inhibit starch and lipid absorption. This effect is very unreliable, to the point where two human studies investigating carbohydrate absorption reported two opposite effects.~~~~Ascophyllum nodosum also contains a compound called ascophyllan, which may have immunostimulatory properties. Ascophyllum nodosum extract has anti-inflammatory properties. Much more research is needed to determine the practical significance of Ascophyllum nodosum supplementation.~~~~Though Ascophyllum nodosum is a healthy food, there is no evidence to support its usefulness as a supplement.
Artichoke Extract|Artichoke Extract (Cynara scolymus) is an extract from the common bulb vegetable that appears to have the ability to stimulate bile secretion; this may underlie a weak reduction in cholesterol and improved fat digestion.
Artemisia iwayomogi|Artemisia iwayomogi (Haninjin) has limited traditional use, but as of late is being investigated for anti-cancer properties. At least one study suggests possible fat-burning effects, and immune-system interactions may be present. Artemisia iwayomogi (Haninjin; the family of artemisia being that of Mugwort) is a herb that is used in part for medicinal effects but for some culinary purposes in Korea, and is in the preliminary stages of research for its benefits.~~~~Currently, there is no human evidence but a few animal studies support that compounds in the water extracts may be potent as an anti-allergic medicine and that a 95% ethanolic extract may possess fat burning properties (via being a PPARδ activatior, a relatively unique mechanism for supplements)
Aronia melanocarpa|Aronia melanocarpa, commonly known as the black chokeberry, is a sour berry with a high anthocyanin and anti-oxidant content. It is being researched for its potential health benefits. Aronia melanocarpa , commonly known as the black chokeberry, is a sour berry being researched for its potential health benefits.~~~~Black chokeberries have a high anthocyanin content. Anthocyanins are the molecules responsible for the blue and red pigments in the berry. Black chokeberries also have more anti-oxidant molecules than blueberries.~~~~Preliminary evidence suggests black chokeberry supplementation can reduce total cholesterol and blood glucose when taken by people with elevated cholesterol and glucose, but further research is needed to confirm this effect.~~~~Black chokeberries do not possess a unique mechanism. The health effects seen with black chokeberry supplementation may be similar to the effects of blueberries and grape seed extract, since black chokeberries also contain cyanidin and procyanidin compounds.~~~~Black chokeberries are a good food choice for people that want to consume more antioxidants and anthocyanins. Personal taste may be an issue, since the berry is sour and astringent.
Arginine|L-Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid. It is important for blood flow and nitric oxide levels, but oral supplementation may not reliably improve blood flow in humans. L-Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid found in the diet. It is a dietary supplement used mostly by athletic people because it is the amino acid that directly produces nitric oxide via the nitric oxide synthase enzymes.~~~~It's particularly important during periods of illness and chronic conditions like hypertension and type II diabetes, as these states tend to be characterized by an increase in the enzyme that degrades L-arginine (known as arginase) resulting in a transient deficiency; this precedes an increase in blood pressure in these states, and can be partially remedied by an increase in L-arginine intake or resolution of the illness/disease state.~~~~L-arginine is a popular supplement for athletes as it is touted to increase nitric oxide activity in the body. Unfortunately, this effect appears to be unreliable in otherwise healthy adults. While there have been studies that have measured increased effects of nitric oxide (blood flow) they are paired with studies showing no net effects. As for the mechanism, there is reason to believe that this difference is in part due to poor absorption of L-arginine from the intestines before it can reach appreciable activity in the body.~~~~L-Citrulline is another supplementation option because it is converted into arginine in the kidneys. It also has a better absorption rate. Citrulline is able to increase levels of plasma arginine more effective than arginine itself. For long-term health-related supplementation, L-citrulline may be a better supplementation option than L-arginine.
Arachidonic acid|Arachidonic acid (AA) is a fatty acid of the omega-6 class, and is the main fatty acid of interest when referring to an omega-3:6 ratio (relative to fish oil fatty acids). It is proinflammatory and immunosupportive.
Apocynum venetum|Apocynum venetum is a plant that potentially reduces blood pressure and depression after supplementation, though more evidence is needed to confirm these effects. Apocynum venetum, commonly known as luobuma or rafuma, is a small shrub, the leaves of which make a tea that is particularly popular in China.~~~~Apocynum venetum is said to have cardioprotective, diuretic, and sedative properties. Apocynum venetum tea has been found to reduce blood pressure in rodent studies, but there is currently no human evidence for these effects.~~~~Drinking Apocynum venetum tea may also have a minor anti-anxiety effect, and a mild antidepressant effect. Both of these claims are based on animal evidence, with no human evidence available at this time.~~~~Further research is needed to determine Apocynum venetum’s main mechanism.~~~~Though there is minimal human evidence for Apocynum venetum’s effects, it appears to be safe to drink. Apocynum venetum and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) have some similar bioactive compounds, including hyperforin. This means that Apocynum venetum may have interactions with other drugs, like St. John’s wort does, but this has not been sufficiently tested.
Apigenin|One of the bioflavonoids, apigenin appears to be catered towards reducing anxiety and causing sedation. Found in chamomile tea, alcoholic beverages, and Bacopa Monnieri, apigenin is unstable by itself yet stable when consumed via foods and herbs. Apigenin is a bioflavonoid compound (specifically a flavone) which is found in a wide variety of plants and herbs. It is very abundant in chamomile tea, and exerts anxiety-reducing effects when consumed in these high doses. At even higher doses, it may be sedative.~~~~Apigenin is also a very potent anti-cancer compound. It beneficially protects against a wide variety of cancers with high selectivity for cancer cells as opposed to non-cancerous cells. It also has a very high safety threshold, and active (anti-cancer) doses can be gained through consuming a vegetable and fruit rich diet.
Aniracetam|Aniracetam is a fat-soluble molecule in the racetams family, anecdotally touted to be more potent than Piracetam and more catered to creativity and holistic thinking as well as reducing anxiety and depression. Human studies are lacking. Aniracetam is a compound in the group of racetams due to its common pyrrolidone structure. It is one of the more common Racetamic structures. It is fat-soluble and thus needs to be ingested with fatty acids. Additionally, Aniracetam is cholinergic~~~~Aniracetam acts as a positive modulator of some excitatory receptors known as AMPA receptors and decreases the rate of receptor desensitization. This typically manifests as a controlled and prolonged neurological stimulation effect. Since AMPA receptors differ in structure across the brain, different AMPA modulators affect the brain in different ways.~~~~Anecdotally, Aniracetam has been know to aid in 'collective and holistic thinking', or putting the pieces of the puzzle together. It also increases blood flow and activity in the area of the brain known for this action, the association cortex.~~~~Aniracetam, as an AMPA modulator, is currently being studied for usage in depression and other CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
Angelica gigas|Angelica gigas is an herb used in traditional Korean medicine, usually by women. It is being studied for its potential anti-cancer and immune-boosting properties. Angelica gigas, also called Dang Gui, is an herb traditionally used in Korean medicine. The plants of the angelica family are used to improve gynecological health.~~~~Though Angelica gigas is often seen as a female supplement, it is also used to improve cardiovascular and immune system health for both men and women.~~~~Preliminary evidence suggests Angelica gigas supplementation may be able to affect hormone levels in a potent way. The herb is also being investigated for its anti-cancer effects, since it may be able to suppress the proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Further research is needed to confirm these effects.~~~~Angelica gigas supplementation increases the level at which B cells reproduce. B cells produce antibodies, so this effect strengthens the immune system.~~~~Angelica gigas is still being researched. It has promise for being used alongside chemotherapy, but more evidence is needed before it can be specifically recommended.
Andrographis paniculata|Andrographis paniculata is an herb frequently used in traditional medicines to treat the common cold.  Andrographis paniculata, commonly known as ‘king of bitters,’ is an herb traditionally used in Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine.~~~~Andrographis paniculata is used to treat the common cold. It is fairly effective when taken for three to five days after the symptoms first appear. However, there is limited human evidence for the effects of this herb, since research tends to focus on the combination therapy of Andrographis paniculata and Eleutherococcus senticosus, also known as Siberian ginseng, and not on Andrographis paniculata by itself.~~~~Andrographis paniculata has also been studied for its anti-cancer effects. In vitro (outside the body) testing and animal research suggest that Andrographis paniculata has an anti-proliferative effect, meaning it is able to slow the spread of cancer cells. The herb does not appear to be able to induce cancer cell death, however.~~~~The bioactive ingredients of Andrographis paniculata can be traced back to a single diterpene molecule called andrographolide.~~~~Some studies have found that prolonged high-dosage Andrographis paniculata can cause toxicity in the testicles and liver. Further research is needed to confirm these effects, since some follow-up studies, using the same methods, failed to replicate the results. Andrographis paniculata is a promising supplement, though currently it is used most often to alleviate the symptoms of the common cold.
Anatabine|Anatabine is an alkaloid compound found in tobacco and plants in the nightshade family, which includes eggplant and peppers. Anatabine possesses anti-inflammatory properties but further research is needed to determine if supplementation is practical.~~Anatabine is an alkaloid found in tobacco and other plants in the nightshade family.~~~~Anatabine is being researched for its anti-inflammatory properties. Preliminary evidence suggests it may be useful to treat autoimmune diseases and Alzheimer’s disease.~~~~Unfortunately, current research uses doses that are significantly higher than the anatabine supplements available on the market. Oral studies tend to use a dose of 1.6mg/kg of bodyweight for people, which translates to dose between 68-110mg for a 150lb person. One human study even failed to find anti-inflammatory effects at a dose that was 6 – 12 times higher than the doses found in today’s anatabine supplements.~~~~Anatabine’s main mechanism works by inhibiting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 protein (STAT3), which inhibits a protein responsible for DNA transcription, called nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (nF-kB). Both Boswellia serrata and Feverfew have a similar mechanism.~~~~Due to limitation of anatabine supplements on the market, it is not a practical anti-inflammatory supplement.
Anacyclus pyrethrum|Anacyclus pyrethrum (Akarkara) is an aphrodisiac herb in ayurveda that is said to enhance male vitality and virility in addition to being a brain tonic. Evidence is preliminary, but it seems to be a profertility agent and testosterone boosting herb with some neuroprotective effects.~~Anacyclus pyrethrum is a pro-fertility and virility enhancing herb that is currently in preliminary testing in rodents. The main bioactives in this plant are the alkylamides (similar to Spilanthes Acmella and Maca), and preliminary evidence seems to confirm its traditional claims of fertility and libido enhancement as well as its role as a 'brain tonic' (since it appears to have anti-amnesiac and anti-convulsive effects).
Alpha-Lipoic Acid|Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a mitochondrial compound involved in energy metabolism. It is commonly taken with L-Carnitine supplements, as they are related in mechanisms. ALA provides a short but potent reduction of oxidation by increasing anti-oxidant enzymes, and may decrease blood glucose acutely.~~Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is a mitochondrial compound that is highly involved in energy metabolism. It is synthesized in the body and can be consumed through eating meat. It is also minimally present in some fruits and vegetables.~~~~In supplement form, it has shown benefit for various forms of oxidation and inflammation. These effects protect against heart diseases, liver diseases, diabetes, and neurological decline associated with aging.~~~~ALA is a potent anti-oxidant compound. It works with mitochondria and the body's natural anti-oxidant defenses. ALA is also seen as an anti-aging compound since it can reverse some of the oxidant damage related to the effects of aging.
Alpha-GPC|Alpha-glycerophosphocholine (Alpha-GPC or α-GPC) is a cholinergic compound that is used for its cognitive-promoting properties, and to enhance power output in athletes. It appears to also support cellular membranes, and may aid in preventing cognitive decline.~~Alpha-GPC (Alpha-glycerophosphocholine or sometimes just glycerophosphocholine) is a choline-containing supplement that, although found in a variety of food products that are also rich in choline, appears to be pharmacologically active at higher doses.~~~~Alpha-GPC is mostly marketed due to it conferring dietary choline to the body following oral ingestion, and being the most efficient choline prodrug at doing so (able to influence both systemic and brain concentrations of choline). Due to the provision of the other half of the alpha-GPC molecule (glycerophosphate), alpha-GPC also appears to support the structure of cellular membranes, which is not a common mechanism attributed to choline prodrugs (only CDP-choline is associated with lipid membranes in this sense).~~~~Oral supplementation of alpha-GPC is of interest for nootropic purposes, as it appears to have cognitive-enhancing properties (no human evidence exists to support this in otherwise-healthy youth, but it does have support in rodents) and attenuate the rate of cognitive decline in the elderly. In regards to reducing the rate of cognitive decline, alpha-GPC at high doses (1,200 mg) does appear to be somewhat effective in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and works nicely with the standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors).~~~~Athletes are at times interested in alpha-GPC due to its ability to enhance growth hormone production (of which only acute spikes have been reported so far, so it may fall to the same problems that arginine has on growth hormone) and to enhance power output, which has a lone pilot study in support of 600 mg alpha-GPC prior to exercise. Although ergogenic properties of alpha-GPC cannot be ruled out and look promising, it requires more evidence.
Aloe vera|Aloe vera is a common houseplant that has traditionally been used topically to alleviate burns and pain on the skin. Oral ingestion helps speed up intestinal motility (and has been used against constipation) and aloe vera contains a large amount of antioxidants.~~Aloe vera is a herb traditionally used to ease digestion as a folk remedy, and to alleviate pain from burns when used topically. It has recently gained popularity as an anti-obesity agent.~~~~Preliminary studies show benefit with aloe vera in controlling weight, but the mechanisms do not seem as potent as other anti-obesity supplements. Aloe vera is also a generally healthy compound, but has been implicated in multiple cases of liver problems (which are not too common, although resurgent) and has a lower toxicity threshold than other herbal supplements.
Alanine|Alanine is a non-essential amino acid used in protein synthesis and the regeneration of glucose within the liver via the glucose–alanine cycle.
Agmatine|Agmatine is a metabolite of L-Arginine. It shows promise for alleviating neuropathic pain and drug addiction and shows some potential in protecting against strokes and benefitting cognitive health.~~Agmatine is derived from L-arginine through decarboxylation (the removal of a carboxylic acid group). It is stored in neurons and is released during neuronal activation. Agmatine is considered to be a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator.~~~~Preliminary research suggests agmatine has potential use in the treatment of neuropathic pain and drug addiction. It also protects the brain from toxins and strokes.~~~~Though supplementing agmatine by itself can increase the perception of pain, it works synergistically with painkillers like morphine and fentanyl. Agmatine’s synergy with opioids allows it to reduce pain killer tolerance, the possibility of addiction, and pain itself.~~~~Agmatine has several mechanisms. It can inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, as well as activate imidazoline receptors. Agmatine can also inhibit nitric oxide synthase enzymes, which allows it to regulate elevated levels of nitric oxide. Agmatine can inhibit calcium channels and certain serotonin receptors as well. Further research is needed to determine the full extent of agmatine’s mechanisms.~~~~There is a lot of animal evidence to suggest agmatine is a highly promising research chemical. It is not a common supplement because there is a lack of human evidence for its effects. Several studies have been done on people, but the majority use agmatine injections, not oral ingestion. Research must establish that agmatine’s effects will work following oral ingestion in order for wide-scale supplementation to be considered.
Aframomum melegueta|Aframomum melegueta (Alligator Pepper, Grains of Paradise) is a herb where the seeds have traditional usage mostly as a pungent spice to season foods with. This herb is botanically in the same family as Ginger and shares many bioactives, and has been (medicinally speaking) traditionally used mostly for digestive and intestinal health with some other sporadic uses not related to food.~~~~When looking at the evidence, most of it is preliminary and a full compositional analysis does not appear to exist at this moment in time. It seems very related to Ginger, and has many of the same bioactives.~~~~Aframomum melegueta appears to have some anti-diabetic and anti-obese mechanisms, although neither are remarkable (the one human study conducted in humans has confirmed an increase in metabolic rate, but required both cold exposure as well as brown fat on the person in question as prerequisites). The aphrodisiac and testosterone boosting properties are both preliminary (with the former not appearing too potent, relative to other herbs) and the anti-estrogen mechanisms are still fairly preliminary and of unknown practical relevance.~~~~Aframomum melegueta may be promising for a spice to add to a diet in hopes of body recomposition and particularly for men, but there is overall a lack of evidence to support its usage as a supplement and higher oral doses may still have some toxicity associated with them (which needs to be more thoroughly investigated)
Adrafinil|Adrafinil is a synthetic nootropic compound. It is a prodrug for modafinil, meaning supplementation of adrafinil leads to increased concentrations of modafinil in the body.~~~~Adrafinil supplementation increases alertness and wakefulness. Adrafinil is a stimulant, but it does not cause hyperactivity. Instead, it fights sleepiness.~~~~Taking adrafinil may also improve memory, but further research is needed to confirm this effect.~~~~Adrafinil works vicariously through modafinil. Further research is needed to determine the exact mechanisms of modafinil, but preliminary evidence suggests histaminergic signaling may play a vital role.~~~~Safety information on adrafinil is lacking because modafinil is often used instead, for treatment of narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness. Long term supplementation of adrafinil is not advised, since adrafinil is metabolized into modafinil in the liver, and there is no available evidence regarding liver safety. Adrafinil and modafinil are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as a nonspecific stimulant compound.
