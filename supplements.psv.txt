Ayurveda|Ayurveda is a branch of medicine originating from India that focuses on oral ingestion of herbs and other supplements for optimal health; similar to Traditional Chinese Medicine, these herbs are being validated scientifically for their historical claims. Ayurveda is the branch of traditional medicine which was localized to India and nearby countries, and similar to Traditional Chinese Medicine in that the 'medicines' used traditionally conists of mostly herbs but also some other things that may be bioactive.~~~~The term Ayurveda is derived from 'Ayus' (life) and 'Ved' (knowledge) as was to refer to accumulated knowledge and practise of sustaining and improving human life and the body.~~~~The section devoted to herbs, alchemy, and chemistry is called Rasayan, and is what Ayurvedic supplementation belongs to.
Astragalus membranaceus|Astragalus membranaceus is one of the fifty fundamental herbs in traditional Chinese medicine. It is used for a variety of purposes and supposedly increases lifespan. It has anti-inflammatory effects and is especially beneficial for the kidneys. Astragalus membranaceus is an important herb in traditional Chinese medicine. It has been used in a wide variety of herbal blends and ‘natural’ remedies, including Dang-gui buxue tang, which is Astragalus membranaceus paired with Angelicae Sinensis.~~~~Astragalus membranaceus has been researched for its cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and longevity effects.~~~~Though Astragalus membranaceus supplementation has been shown to reduce the metabolic and physical complications of aging, there are currently no studies that show an actual increase in lifespan. The flavonoid content of Astragalus membranaceus may also contribute to its cardioprotective effects. Its polysaccharide content also protects the heart because it is a potent anti-inflammatory agent, and it is able to reduce cholesterol levels, similar to psyllium husk, which is a fiber supplement.~~~~The main mechanism of Astragalus membranaceus is a result of its active ingredients. The main component is astragaloside IV, which has been extracted, isolated and patented under the name TA-65 and marketed as a longevity agent. Unfortunately, astragaloside IV has a low bioavailability, meaning it doesn’t circulate well through the body after being ingested. This means it can only be present in the body at low concentrations. Still, low concentrations of astragaloside IV can provide cardioprotective effects. Several studies done on astragaloside IV have conflicting sources of funding, and while that doesn’t invalidate the results, replication by a third party would go a long way toward confirming the effects of astragaloside IV.~~~~Astragalus membranaceus supplementation can provide a variety of health benefits, but may not actually prolong lifespan. Like resveratrol, Astragalus membranaceus is a compound that adds life to your years, rather than adding years to your life.
Asteracantha longifolia|Asteracantha longifolia (Kokilaaksha) is an ayurvedic aphrodisiac and liver protective agent. Currently, research on this plant is preliminary with limited information on both components of the plant and toxicology. Asteracantha longifolia (synonymous with quite a few other plant and traditional names) is a traditional Indian medicine that is reported to be beneficial against glucose disturbances (Diabetes) and against liver problems; in addition to these two therapeutic claims, it is reported to be a diuretic and an aphrodisiac.~~~~At this moment in time there is not much information on this herb, but it appears to have some interactions with glucose metabolism in the sense that it can augment glycogen synthesis in the liver and muscle tissue (mechanism unknown) and it appears to protect the liver and brain from lipid peroxidation with a potency somewhat comparable to Vitamin E.
Astaxanthin|Astaxanthin is an aquatic carotenoid like fucoxanthin, but is the red pigment in salmon and krill; the most stable of all carotenoids and touted to aid in eye health and inflammation. Limited human evidence, but it appears to be a better carotenoid than the more researched lutein and zeaxanthin. Astaxanthin is a red-pink pigment found in various seafoods, and also in the feathers of flamingos and quails. It is structurally similar to beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A) but has some chemical differences which may be safer.~~~~It seems to be able to improve many blood parameters that could be beneficial to heart disease. At doses of 6-8mg daily, it can decrease the oxidation of LDL cholesterol and prevent it from becoming artherogenic (artery clogging). It can increase general blood flow and reduce blood sugar in diabetics and blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (humans not studied yet) with no effect on these measures in normal healthy persons.~~~~Additionally, it is also a potent anti-inflammatory and has more anti-oxidant capabilities than vitamin A itself.
Asparagus racemosus|Asparagus racemosus is an herb used in Ayurveda medicine. It is not the commonly consumed vegetable, but it is a related plant. Asparagus racemosus is an herb used in Ayurveda medicine. It is not the vegetable usually called asparagus.~~~~Supplementing Asparagus racemosus will aid digestion, since the plant has anti-ulcer effects. It will also aid the immune system when antibodies are fighting off a threat. Asparagus racemosus also has aphrodisiac, antidepressant and anxiety-reducing effects.~~~~But for anxiety, depression and libido, Asparagus racemosus is outclassed by other herbs. For example, Ashwagandha is more effective at reducing anxiety and depression, while Panax ginseng provides more physical benefits.~~~~Though Asparagus racemosus has been used as a galactagogue to increase breast milk production, this area needs further research before Asparagus racemosus supplementation can be specifically recommended.
Ashwagandha|Ashwagandha has been called the king of Ayurvedic herbs. Limited research suggests that it works well for reducing stress and anxiety. It may also modestly enhance strength performance, improve glucose metabolism, and increase testosterone levels, but more research is needed to confirm this.  What is Ashwagandha?~~Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is an herb used in Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India. Its root has a horsey smell (in Sanskrit, ashva means “horse” and gandha means “smell”) and is said to confer the strength and virility of a horse. Various parts of the plant are used, but the most common in supplements is an extract of its roots.~~~~~~What are Ashwagandha's benefits?~~A number of studies suggest that it has anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects; studies are mostly supportive of a notable effect of ashwagandha for this purpose, and it seems to reduce cortisol levels. However, more research is needed before we can have a great deal of confidence in it or know the optimal dose. Ashwagandha may also be able to reduce insomnia, fatigue, and the symptoms of depression, but it hasn't been well-researched for these purposes.~~~~It may increase power output in untrained subjects during resistance exercise and anaerobic running, but this observation is based on a small amount of research and more is needed. It may lead to small reductions in blood glucose, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol, while slightly increasing HDL-cholesterol. Additionally, it may modestly increase testosterone and sperm quality in infertile men.~~~~~~What are Ashwagandha's side effects and drawbacks?~~It seems to be safe, but it needs more long-term research that's specifically designed to evaluate its safety. It may cause mild drowsiness and sedation for some people.~~~~~~Can I take Ashwagandha daily?~~This question is difficult to answer because we currently lack a lot of long-term information from clinical trials. Because of its possible drug-like effects on neurotransmission, it's difficult to rule out unintended side-effects or a loss of potency in the long-term. However, what studies we do have generally suggest that the effects of Ashwagandha on stress/anxiety continually improve for at least for two months after the beginning of daily supplementation. Furthermore, the studies use Ashwagandha daily, and if a study finds an effect, the best way to get that same effect is to mimic the dose and dosing schedule in the study. Tt is unknown if taking breaks from Ashwagandha or taking it every other day will yield the same effects.
Ascophyllum nodosum|Ascophyllum nodosum is a species of seaweed. It is being investigated for its immunostimulatory properties and it may inhibit carbohydrate absorption after supplementation. Ascophyllum nodosum is a species of seaweed found around the globe. It is one of the many species of seaweed called kelp.~~~~Ascophyllum nodosum contains compounds called phlorotannins, which are unique to seaweed and may be able to inhibit starch and lipid absorption. This effect is very unreliable, to the point where two human studies investigating carbohydrate absorption reported two opposite effects.~~~~Ascophyllum nodosum also contains a compound called ascophyllan, which may have immunostimulatory properties. Ascophyllum nodosum extract has anti-inflammatory properties. Much more research is needed to determine the practical significance of Ascophyllum nodosum supplementation.~~~~Though Ascophyllum nodosum is a healthy food, there is no evidence to support its usefulness as a supplement.
Artichoke Extract|Artichoke Extract (Cynara scolymus) is an extract from the common bulb vegetable that appears to have the ability to stimulate bile secretion; this may underlie a weak reduction in cholesterol and improved fat digestion.
Artemisia iwayomogi|Artemisia iwayomogi (Haninjin) has limited traditional use, but as of late is being investigated for anti-cancer properties. At least one study suggests possible fat-burning effects, and immune-system interactions may be present. Artemisia iwayomogi (Haninjin; the family of artemisia being that of Mugwort) is a herb that is used in part for medicinal effects but for some culinary purposes in Korea, and is in the preliminary stages of research for its benefits.~~~~Currently, there is no human evidence but a few animal studies support that compounds in the water extracts may be potent as an anti-allergic medicine and that a 95% ethanolic extract may possess fat burning properties (via being a PPARδ activatior, a relatively unique mechanism for supplements)
Aronia melanocarpa|Aronia melanocarpa, commonly known as the black chokeberry, is a sour berry with a high anthocyanin and anti-oxidant content. It is being researched for its potential health benefits. Aronia melanocarpa , commonly known as the black chokeberry, is a sour berry being researched for its potential health benefits.~~~~Black chokeberries have a high anthocyanin content. Anthocyanins are the molecules responsible for the blue and red pigments in the berry. Black chokeberries also have more anti-oxidant molecules than blueberries.~~~~Preliminary evidence suggests black chokeberry supplementation can reduce total cholesterol and blood glucose when taken by people with elevated cholesterol and glucose, but further research is needed to confirm this effect.~~~~Black chokeberries do not possess a unique mechanism. The health effects seen with black chokeberry supplementation may be similar to the effects of blueberries and grape seed extract, since black chokeberries also contain cyanidin and procyanidin compounds.~~~~Black chokeberries are a good food choice for people that want to consume more antioxidants and anthocyanins. Personal taste may be an issue, since the berry is sour and astringent.
Arginine|L-Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid. It is important for blood flow and nitric oxide levels, but oral supplementation may not reliably improve blood flow in humans. L-Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid found in the diet. It is a dietary supplement used mostly by athletic people because it is the amino acid that directly produces nitric oxide via the nitric oxide synthase enzymes.~~~~It's particularly important during periods of illness and chronic conditions like hypertension and type II diabetes, as these states tend to be characterized by an increase in the enzyme that degrades L-arginine (known as arginase) resulting in a transient deficiency; this precedes an increase in blood pressure in these states, and can be partially remedied by an increase in L-arginine intake or resolution of the illness/disease state.~~~~L-arginine is a popular supplement for athletes as it is touted to increase nitric oxide activity in the body. Unfortunately, this effect appears to be unreliable in otherwise healthy adults. While there have been studies that have measured increased effects of nitric oxide (blood flow) they are paired with studies showing no net effects. As for the mechanism, there is reason to believe that this difference is in part due to poor absorption of L-arginine from the intestines before it can reach appreciable activity in the body.~~~~L-Citrulline is another supplementation option because it is converted into arginine in the kidneys. It also has a better absorption rate. Citrulline is able to increase levels of plasma arginine more effective than arginine itself. For long-term health-related supplementation, L-citrulline may be a better supplementation option than L-arginine.
Arachidonic acid|Arachidonic acid (AA) is a fatty acid of the omega-6 class, and is the main fatty acid of interest when referring to an omega-3:6 ratio (relative to fish oil fatty acids). It is proinflammatory and immunosupportive.
Apocynum venetum|Apocynum venetum is a plant that potentially reduces blood pressure and depression after supplementation, though more evidence is needed to confirm these effects. Apocynum venetum, commonly known as luobuma or rafuma, is a small shrub, the leaves of which make a tea that is particularly popular in China.~~~~Apocynum venetum is said to have cardioprotective, diuretic, and sedative properties. Apocynum venetum tea has been found to reduce blood pressure in rodent studies, but there is currently no human evidence for these effects.~~~~Drinking Apocynum venetum tea may also have a minor anti-anxiety effect, and a mild antidepressant effect. Both of these claims are based on animal evidence, with no human evidence available at this time.~~~~Further research is needed to determine Apocynum venetum’s main mechanism.~~~~Though there is minimal human evidence for Apocynum venetum’s effects, it appears to be safe to drink. Apocynum venetum and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) have some similar bioactive compounds, including hyperforin. This means that Apocynum venetum may have interactions with other drugs, like St. John’s wort does, but this has not been sufficiently tested.
Apigenin|One of the bioflavonoids, apigenin appears to be catered towards reducing anxiety and causing sedation. Found in chamomile tea, alcoholic beverages, and Bacopa Monnieri, apigenin is unstable by itself yet stable when consumed via foods and herbs. Apigenin is a bioflavonoid compound (specifically a flavone) which is found in a wide variety of plants and herbs. It is very abundant in chamomile tea, and exerts anxiety-reducing effects when consumed in these high doses. At even higher doses, it may be sedative.~~~~Apigenin is also a very potent anti-cancer compound. It beneficially protects against a wide variety of cancers with high selectivity for cancer cells as opposed to non-cancerous cells. It also has a very high safety threshold, and active (anti-cancer) doses can be gained through consuming a vegetable and fruit rich diet.
Aniracetam|Aniracetam is a fat-soluble molecule in the racetams family, anecdotally touted to be more potent than Piracetam and more catered to creativity and holistic thinking as well as reducing anxiety and depression. Human studies are lacking. Aniracetam is a compound in the group of racetams due to its common pyrrolidone structure. It is one of the more common Racetamic structures. It is fat-soluble and thus needs to be ingested with fatty acids. Additionally, Aniracetam is cholinergic~~~~Aniracetam acts as a positive modulator of some excitatory receptors known as AMPA receptors and decreases the rate of receptor desensitization. This typically manifests as a controlled and prolonged neurological stimulation effect. Since AMPA receptors differ in structure across the brain, different AMPA modulators affect the brain in different ways.~~~~Anecdotally, Aniracetam has been know to aid in 'collective and holistic thinking', or putting the pieces of the puzzle together. It also increases blood flow and activity in the area of the brain known for this action, the association cortex.~~~~Aniracetam, as an AMPA modulator, is currently being studied for usage in depression and other CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
Angelica gigas|Angelica gigas is an herb used in traditional Korean medicine, usually by women. It is being studied for its potential anti-cancer and immune-boosting properties. Angelica gigas, also called Dang Gui, is an herb traditionally used in Korean medicine. The plants of the angelica family are used to improve gynecological health.~~~~Though Angelica gigas is often seen as a female supplement, it is also used to improve cardiovascular and immune system health for both men and women.~~~~Preliminary evidence suggests Angelica gigas supplementation may be able to affect hormone levels in a potent way. The herb is also being investigated for its anti-cancer effects, since it may be able to suppress the proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Further research is needed to confirm these effects.~~~~Angelica gigas supplementation increases the level at which B cells reproduce. B cells produce antibodies, so this effect strengthens the immune system.~~~~Angelica gigas is still being researched. It has promise for being used alongside chemotherapy, but more evidence is needed before it can be specifically recommended.
Andrographis paniculata|Andrographis paniculata is an herb frequently used in traditional medicines to treat the common cold.  Andrographis paniculata, commonly known as ‘king of bitters,’ is an herb traditionally used in Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine.~~~~Andrographis paniculata is used to treat the common cold. It is fairly effective when taken for three to five days after the symptoms first appear. However, there is limited human evidence for the effects of this herb, since research tends to focus on the combination therapy of Andrographis paniculata and Eleutherococcus senticosus, also known as Siberian ginseng, and not on Andrographis paniculata by itself.~~~~Andrographis paniculata has also been studied for its anti-cancer effects. In vitro (outside the body) testing and animal research suggest that Andrographis paniculata has an anti-proliferative effect, meaning it is able to slow the spread of cancer cells. The herb does not appear to be able to induce cancer cell death, however.~~~~The bioactive ingredients of Andrographis paniculata can be traced back to a single diterpene molecule called andrographolide.~~~~Some studies have found that prolonged high-dosage Andrographis paniculata can cause toxicity in the testicles and liver. Further research is needed to confirm these effects, since some follow-up studies, using the same methods, failed to replicate the results. Andrographis paniculata is a promising supplement, though currently it is used most often to alleviate the symptoms of the common cold.
Anatabine|Anatabine is an alkaloid compound found in tobacco and plants in the nightshade family, which includes eggplant and peppers. Anatabine possesses anti-inflammatory properties but further research is needed to determine if supplementation is practical.~~Anatabine is an alkaloid found in tobacco and other plants in the nightshade family.~~~~Anatabine is being researched for its anti-inflammatory properties. Preliminary evidence suggests it may be useful to treat autoimmune diseases and Alzheimer’s disease.~~~~Unfortunately, current research uses doses that are significantly higher than the anatabine supplements available on the market. Oral studies tend to use a dose of 1.6mg/kg of bodyweight for people, which translates to dose between 68-110mg for a 150lb person. One human study even failed to find anti-inflammatory effects at a dose that was 6 – 12 times higher than the doses found in today’s anatabine supplements.~~~~Anatabine’s main mechanism works by inhibiting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 protein (STAT3), which inhibits a protein responsible for DNA transcription, called nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (nF-kB). Both Boswellia serrata and Feverfew have a similar mechanism.~~~~Due to limitation of anatabine supplements on the market, it is not a practical anti-inflammatory supplement.
Anacyclus pyrethrum|Anacyclus pyrethrum (Akarkara) is an aphrodisiac herb in ayurveda that is said to enhance male vitality and virility in addition to being a brain tonic. Evidence is preliminary, but it seems to be a profertility agent and testosterone boosting herb with some neuroprotective effects.~~Anacyclus pyrethrum is a pro-fertility and virility enhancing herb that is currently in preliminary testing in rodents. The main bioactives in this plant are the alkylamides (similar to Spilanthes Acmella and Maca), and preliminary evidence seems to confirm its traditional claims of fertility and libido enhancement as well as its role as a 'brain tonic' (since it appears to have anti-amnesiac and anti-convulsive effects).
Alpha-Lipoic Acid|Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a mitochondrial compound involved in energy metabolism. It is commonly taken with L-Carnitine supplements, as they are related in mechanisms. ALA provides a short but potent reduction of oxidation by increasing anti-oxidant enzymes, and may decrease blood glucose acutely.~~Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is a mitochondrial compound that is highly involved in energy metabolism. It is synthesized in the body and can be consumed through eating meat. It is also minimally present in some fruits and vegetables.~~~~In supplement form, it has shown benefit for various forms of oxidation and inflammation. These effects protect against heart diseases, liver diseases, diabetes, and neurological decline associated with aging.~~~~ALA is a potent anti-oxidant compound. It works with mitochondria and the body's natural anti-oxidant defenses. ALA is also seen as an anti-aging compound since it can reverse some of the oxidant damage related to the effects of aging.
Alpha-GPC|Alpha-glycerophosphocholine (Alpha-GPC or α-GPC) is a cholinergic compound that is used for its cognitive-promoting properties, and to enhance power output in athletes. It appears to also support cellular membranes, and may aid in preventing cognitive decline.~~Alpha-GPC (Alpha-glycerophosphocholine or sometimes just glycerophosphocholine) is a choline-containing supplement that, although found in a variety of food products that are also rich in choline, appears to be pharmacologically active at higher doses.~~~~Alpha-GPC is mostly marketed due to it conferring dietary choline to the body following oral ingestion, and being the most efficient choline prodrug at doing so (able to influence both systemic and brain concentrations of choline). Due to the provision of the other half of the alpha-GPC molecule (glycerophosphate), alpha-GPC also appears to support the structure of cellular membranes, which is not a common mechanism attributed to choline prodrugs (only CDP-choline is associated with lipid membranes in this sense).~~~~Oral supplementation of alpha-GPC is of interest for nootropic purposes, as it appears to have cognitive-enhancing properties (no human evidence exists to support this in otherwise-healthy youth, but it does have support in rodents) and attenuate the rate of cognitive decline in the elderly. In regards to reducing the rate of cognitive decline, alpha-GPC at high doses (1,200 mg) does appear to be somewhat effective in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and works nicely with the standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors).~~~~Athletes are at times interested in alpha-GPC due to its ability to enhance growth hormone production (of which only acute spikes have been reported so far, so it may fall to the same problems that arginine has on growth hormone) and to enhance power output, which has a lone pilot study in support of 600 mg alpha-GPC prior to exercise. Although ergogenic properties of alpha-GPC cannot be ruled out and look promising, it requires more evidence.
Aloe vera|Aloe vera is a common houseplant that has traditionally been used topically to alleviate burns and pain on the skin. Oral ingestion helps speed up intestinal motility (and has been used against constipation) and aloe vera contains a large amount of antioxidants.~~Aloe vera is a herb traditionally used to ease digestion as a folk remedy, and to alleviate pain from burns when used topically. It has recently gained popularity as an anti-obesity agent.~~~~Preliminary studies show benefit with aloe vera in controlling weight, but the mechanisms do not seem as potent as other anti-obesity supplements. Aloe vera is also a generally healthy compound, but has been implicated in multiple cases of liver problems (which are not too common, although resurgent) and has a lower toxicity threshold than other herbal supplements.
Alanine|Alanine is a non-essential amino acid used in protein synthesis and the regeneration of glucose within the liver via the glucose–alanine cycle.
Agmatine|Agmatine is a metabolite of L-Arginine. It shows promise for alleviating neuropathic pain and drug addiction and shows some potential in protecting against strokes and benefitting cognitive health.~~Agmatine is derived from L-arginine through decarboxylation (the removal of a carboxylic acid group). It is stored in neurons and is released during neuronal activation. Agmatine is considered to be a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator.~~~~Preliminary research suggests agmatine has potential use in the treatment of neuropathic pain and drug addiction. It also protects the brain from toxins and strokes.~~~~Though supplementing agmatine by itself can increase the perception of pain, it works synergistically with painkillers like morphine and fentanyl. Agmatine’s synergy with opioids allows it to reduce pain killer tolerance, the possibility of addiction, and pain itself.~~~~Agmatine has several mechanisms. It can inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, as well as activate imidazoline receptors. Agmatine can also inhibit nitric oxide synthase enzymes, which allows it to regulate elevated levels of nitric oxide. Agmatine can inhibit calcium channels and certain serotonin receptors as well. Further research is needed to determine the full extent of agmatine’s mechanisms.~~~~There is a lot of animal evidence to suggest agmatine is a highly promising research chemical. It is not a common supplement because there is a lack of human evidence for its effects. Several studies have been done on people, but the majority use agmatine injections, not oral ingestion. Research must establish that agmatine’s effects will work following oral ingestion in order for wide-scale supplementation to be considered.
Aframomum melegueta|Aframomum melegueta (Alligator Pepper, Grains of Paradise) is a herb where the seeds have traditional usage mostly as a pungent spice to season foods with. This herb is botanically in the same family as Ginger and shares many bioactives, and has been (medicinally speaking) traditionally used mostly for digestive and intestinal health with some other sporadic uses not related to food.~~~~When looking at the evidence, most of it is preliminary and a full compositional analysis does not appear to exist at this moment in time. It seems very related to Ginger, and has many of the same bioactives.~~~~Aframomum melegueta appears to have some anti-diabetic and anti-obese mechanisms, although neither are remarkable (the one human study conducted in humans has confirmed an increase in metabolic rate, but required both cold exposure as well as brown fat on the person in question as prerequisites). The aphrodisiac and testosterone boosting properties are both preliminary (with the former not appearing too potent, relative to other herbs) and the anti-estrogen mechanisms are still fairly preliminary and of unknown practical relevance.~~~~Aframomum melegueta may be promising for a spice to add to a diet in hopes of body recomposition and particularly for men, but there is overall a lack of evidence to support its usage as a supplement and higher oral doses may still have some toxicity associated with them (which needs to be more thoroughly investigated)
Adrafinil|Adrafinil is a synthetic nootropic compound. It is a prodrug for modafinil, meaning supplementation of adrafinil leads to increased concentrations of modafinil in the body.~~~~Adrafinil supplementation increases alertness and wakefulness. Adrafinil is a stimulant, but it does not cause hyperactivity. Instead, it fights sleepiness.~~~~Taking adrafinil may also improve memory, but further research is needed to confirm this effect.~~~~Adrafinil works vicariously through modafinil. Further research is needed to determine the exact mechanisms of modafinil, but preliminary evidence suggests histaminergic signaling may play a vital role.~~~~Safety information on adrafinil is lacking because modafinil is often used instead, for treatment of narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness. Long term supplementation of adrafinil is not advised, since adrafinil is metabolized into modafinil in the liver, and there is no available evidence regarding liver safety. Adrafinil and modafinil are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as a nonspecific stimulant compound.
